Around 25% of the EU population experience a deterioration in the quality of life due to annoyance and about 5\u201315% suffer from sleep disorders, with many disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost annually. This systematic review highlights the main sources of urban noise, the relevant principal clinical disorders and the most effected countries. This review included articles published on the major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus), using a combination of some keywords. The online search yielded 265 references; after selection, the authors have analyzed 54 articles (5 reviews and 49 original articles).

Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes health problems by leading a healthy lifestyle, taking your medicines, and managing your blood glucose level, also called blood sugar level. Work with your health care team to create a diabetes care plan that works for you. What are the diabetes ABCs? The diabetes ABCs can help you manage your blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. If you smoke, quitting is also important. Managing your ABCs may lower your chances of having health problems from diabetes, such as a heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and foot or leg amputations. A is for the A1C blood glucose test The A1C test shows your average blood glucose level over the last 3 months. This test is done at a health care professional\u2019s office or lab. For most people with diabetes, their goal is an A1C level below 7%.1 Your A1C goal may be different if you have other health problems.2 Ask your health care team how often you should have the test and what your goal should be. B is for blood pressure High blood pressure can damage your heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Some people with diabetes have a blood pressure goal below 130/80 mm Hg.2,3 If you have heart disease or are at high risk for diabetes health problems, your goal may be lower.

REFERENCE DOSE (RfD): DESCRIPTION AND USE IN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS This concept paper describes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) principal approach to and rationale for assessing risk for health effects other than cancer and gene mutations from chronic chemical exposure. By outlining principles and concepts that guide EPA risk assessment for such systemic effects the paper complements the new risk assessment guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1987), which describe the Agency's approach to risk assessment in other areas, specifically carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental toxicity, exposure, and chemical mixtures. (In this document the term \"systemic toxicity\" refers to an effect other than carcinogenicity or mutagenicity induced by a toxic chemical.) Chemicals that give rise to toxic endpoints other than cancer and gene mutations are often referred to as \"systemic toxicants\" because of their effects on the function of various organ systems. In addition, chemicals that cause cancer and gene mutations also commonly evoke other toxic effects (i.e., systemic toxicity). Based on our understanding of homeostatic and adaptive mechanisms, systemic toxicity is treated as if there is an identifiable exposure threshold (both for the individual and for populations) below which there are no observable adverse effects.

A healthy balanced diet, rich in fruit and vegetables as well as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3 PUFA), could reduce oxidative stress and improve markers of low-grade inflammation. Nonetheless, considering that a large part of the population struggles to meet current guidelines on fruit and vegetable and n3 PUFA recommendations, fruit and vegetable concentrate supplements and mixed omega fatty acid supplements could be an effective strategy to bridge the gap between actual and recommended intakes. Methods In this randomised, controlled, open-labelled, parallel-grouped clinical trial, 112 participants will be allocated to one of four arms (n = 28 on each arm): an encapsulated juice powder concentrate, a plant-based omega fatty acid supplement, both or a control group.

Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) are available to the individuals below: - Age 65 or older - Disabled - End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) Most people get Part A for free, but some have to pay a premium for this coverage. To be eligible for premium-free Part A, an individual must be entitled to receive Medicare based on their own earnings or those of a spouse, parent, or child. To receive premium-free Part A, the worker must have a specified number of quarters of coverage (QCs) and file an application for Social Security or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) benefits. The exact number of QCs required is dependent on whether the person is filing for Part A on the basis of age, disability, or End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). QCs are earned through payment of payroll taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) during the person's working years. Most individuals pay the full FICA tax so the QCs they earn can be used to meet the requirements for both monthly Social Security benefits and premium-free Part A. NOTE: Certain Federal, State, and local government employees pay only the Part A portion of the FICA tax. The QCs they earn can be used only to meet the requirements for premium-free Part A; they may not be used to meet the requirements for monthly Social Security benefits.

With the growing problem of obesity, for example, research shows a link to several mental health issues. In one meta-analysis, researchers found a clear association between ADHD and obesity in adults. In cases like these, health practitioners need to not only have an understanding of obesity but also know how issues like mental health and genetics impact weight gain. As more awareness builds around the complexity of our overall health, job prospects are increasing for health education specialists. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the expected job growth rate for health education specialists from 2022-32 is 7%, faster than the average rate of all occupations (2.8%). Health education specialists work in a variety of settings, including clinical health organizations, community/non-profit health organizations, government health agencies, colleges and universities, schools, and businesses/worksites. Becoming certified in the field can help health education specialists advance their careers and signify to potential employers that they have mastered key competencies for the profession. According to job market analysis tool Lightcast, job listings with the Certified Health Education Specialist credential have increased 254% from 2020 to 2023.

The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (Public Act 105-115)[4] amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to require that the NIH create and operate a public information resource, which came to be called ClinicalTrials.gov, tracking drug efficacy studies resulting from approved Investigational New Drug (IND) applications (FDA Regulations 21 CFR Parts 312 and 812).[5] With the primary purpose of improving access of the public to clinical trials where individuals with serious diseases and conditions might find experimental treatments, this law required information about: - Federally and privately funded clinical trials; - The purpose of each experimental drug; - Subject eligibility criteria to participate in the clinical trial; - The location of clinical trial sites being used for a study; and - A point of contact for patients interested in enrolling in the trial.

Overview CDC recommends all women capable of becoming pregnant get 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily. Getting 400 mcg of folic acid each day helps prevent some serious birth defects called neural tube defects (NTDs). There are multiple ways to meet this recommendation. You can get folic acid from supplements, such as vitamins, or from foods where folic acid has been added, such as enriched bread. It is also important to have a varied diet with folate-rich foods such as dark green leafy vegetables and beans. Terms to know Fortification is a way to add vitamins or minerals, or both, to foods. Flours, pastas, breads, rice, and breakfast cereals fortified with folic acid will be labeled \"enriched.\" Mandatory fortification requires food manufacturers to add certain vitamins or minerals, or both, to specified foods. This is done to address a significant public health need. For example, fortification of cereal grains with folic acid is mandated in the United States to help reduce the occurrence of NTDs. Voluntary fortification allows food manufacturers to add vitamins or minerals, or both, to foods. Manufacturers need to follow the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food additive regulations. Dietary supplements are products taken by mouth that contain ingredients intended to add nutrients to the diet. Vitamins are a type of dietary supplement that can contain folic acid. Sources of folic acid Fortified foods Fortified foods provide an important source of folic acid. Folic acid is added to some staple foods to help people meet their daily needs.

Text equivalent Measles (Rubeola) Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that causes febrile rash illness. Measles has been eliminated (no sustained circulation) in the United States for decades. However, there can still be measles cases, as it is easily imported by unvaccinated travelers and can spread in under-immunized communities. Disease course The incubation period is typically 11\u201312 days from exposure to measles virus until the first symptoms appear (prodromal symptoms). A rash follows the prodromal symptoms 2\u20134 days later and usually lasts 5\u20136 days. Measles is infectious 4 days before and 4 days after rash onset. Symptoms Prodromal: Fever, cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis. Koplik spots (tiny white spots inside the mouth) may also appear 2\u20133 days after symptoms first appear. Rash: A maculopapular rash (rash of both flat and raised skin lesions) begins on the head and face and then spreads downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs, and feet. The spots may become joined together as they spread from the head to the body. Fever may spike to more than 104\u00b0 F when rash appears. Complications Most common complications: Diarrhea and otitis media. Most severe complications: Pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Patients may require hospitalization. Children younger than 5, adults older than 20, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons are at most risk of serious complications. What to do if you have a suspected case - Immediately mask and isolate the patient in a room with a closed door (negative pressure room if available). Follow standard and airborne precautions. - Only allow health care workers with presumptive evidence of measles immunity* to attend the patient; they must use N-95 masks. - Evaluate the patient and order measles confi"

Materials and Methods: This study adopted a desk methodology. A desk study research design is commonly known as secondary data collection. This is basically collecting data from existing resources preferably because of its low cost advantage as compared to a field research. Our current study looked into already published studies and reports as the data was easily accessed through online journals and libraries. Findings: The study found that high levels of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are closely linked to respiratory conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.

Only combination MMR and MMRV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Presumptive evidence of immunity can be established in any of the following ways: - Written documentation of one or more doses of a measles-containing vaccine administered on or after the first birthday for preschool-age children and adults not considered high risk - Written documentation of two doses of measles-containing vaccine for school-age children and adults at high risk, including students at post-high school secondary educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers - Laboratory evidence of immunity - Laboratory confirmation of disease - Birth before 1957 (see below for presumptive evidence of immunity criteria for health care personnel born before 1957) CDC recommends two doses of measles-containing vaccine routinely for children, starting with the first dose at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. This can be administered as MMR or MMRV vaccine. Children can receive the second dose of MMR vaccine earlier than 4 through 6 years, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. A second dose of MMRV vaccine can be given 3 months after the first dose up to 12 years of age. CDC recommends that separate MMR and varicella vaccines be given for the first dose in children aged 12\u201347 months; however, MMRV may be used if parents or caregivers express a preference. Adults should also be up to date on MMR vaccinations with either 1 or 2 doses (depending on risk factors) unless they have other presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella.

Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium can be bad for your health. Diets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, which is a major cause of stroke and heart disease. Despite what many people think, most dietary sodium (over 70%) comes from eating packaged and prepared foods\u2014not from table salt added to food when cooking or eating. The food supply contains too much sodium and Americans who want to consume less sodium can have a difficult time doing so. That is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with the food industry to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods. Even though sodium may already be in many packaged foods when you purchase them, you can lower your daily sodium intake by using the Nutrition Facts label. Look at the Label! Use the Nutrition Facts label as your tool to make informed decisions! - Know the Daily Value. The Daily Values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day. The Daily Value for sodium is less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day. Use % Daily Value (%DV) as a tool. The %DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food and shows how much of a nutrient contributes to a total daily diet. Use %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in sodium and to compare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV of sodium each day. As a general guide: 5% DV or less of sodium per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of sodium per serving is considered high. - Pay attention to servings. The nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts label is usually based on one serving of the food.

      "text": "Abstract PURPOSE The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent body that makes evidence-based recommendations regarding preventive services to improve health for people nationwide. Here, we summarize current USPSTF methods, describe how methods are evolving to address preventive health equity, and define evidence gaps for future research. METHODS We summarize current USPSTF methods as well as ongoing methods development. RESULTS The USPSTF prioritizes topics on the basis of disease burden, extent of new evidence, and whether the service can be provided in primary care and going forward will increasingly consider health equity. Analytic frameworks specify the key questions and linkages connecting the preventive service to health outcomes. Contextual questions provide information on natural history, current practice, health outcomes in high-risk groups, and health equity. The USPSTF assigns a level of certainty to the estimate of net benefit of a preventive service (high, moderate, or low). The magnitude of net benefit is also judged (substantial, moderate, small, or zero/negative). The USPSTF uses these assessments to assign a letter grade from A (recommend) to D (recommend against). I statements are issued when evidence is insufficient. CONCLUSIONS The USPSTF will continue to evolve its methods for simulation modeling and to use evidence to address conditions for which there are limited data for population groups who bear a disproportionate burden of disease. Additional pilot work is underway to better understand the relations of the social constructs of race, ethnicity, and gender with health outcomes to inform the development of a USPSTF health equity framework. Key words: preventive medicine, clinical practice guidelines, methodology, health equity INTRODUCTION The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent body formed in 1984 to make evidence-based recommendations regarding preventive services including screening, behavioral "

There are many different systems of traditional medicine, and the philosophy and practices of each are influenced by the prevailing conditions, environment, and geographic area within which it first evolved (WHO 2005), however, a common philosophy is a holistic approach to life, equilibrium of the mind, body, and the environment, and an empha",

      "text": "Abstract Background: Depression diagnosis requires five or more symptoms (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-DSM-5). One of them must be either Depressed mood or Anhedonia, named main criteria. Although the secondary symptoms can be divided into somatic and non-somatic clusters, the DSM-5 identify depression in all or none fashion. In contrast, depression severity is a continuous variable. Therefore, it is commonly assessed with scales such as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Previously, we reported that patients with moderate depression (MD) exhibit greater impairments in cardiac-autonomic modulation than severely depressed (SD) patients. However, clinicians usually do not use scales. Objective: To verify whether the DSM-5 symptoms would be able to discriminate SD from MD and MD from non-depressed (ND) subjects. Material and Methods: Depression was diagnosed based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5\u00ae Disorders. The HAMD evaluated depression severity. In depressed subjects, MD and SD were defined considering the HAMD scores. ND was defined considering both the absence of DSM-5 criteria for depression and the HAMD score. Among 782 outpatients, 46 SD were found. MD and ND subjects were randomly sampled to match the demographic variables of the SD group. Results: Discriminant analysis showed that Depressed Mood was the most reliable symptom to discriminate ND from MD. Anhedonia discriminated SD from MD. Among the secondary DSM-5 criteria, the somatic cluster discriminated ND from MD and the non-somatic cluster SD from MD patients. Discussion: The presence of the somatic cluster in MD may indicate decreased vagal tone and/or increased sympathetic tone, leading to higher cardiovascular risk. As SD is associated with the non-somatic cluster, these patients are at risk of committing suicide. The DSM-5 symptoms exhibited by the patient may help the choice of adequate pharmacological treatment. This would avoid the use of antidepress"

Underdiagnosis and undertreatment of anaphylaxis are public health concerns. Objective: This guideline aimed to provide high-quality and evidence-based recommendations for the emergency management of anaphylaxis. Method: The panel of health professionals from fifteen medical areas selected twenty-five clinical questions and formulated the recommendations with the supervision of four methodologists. We collected evidence by conducting systematic literature retrieval and using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: This guideline made twenty-five recommendations that covered the diagnosis, preparation, emergency treatment, and post-emergency management of anaphylaxis. We recommended the use of a set of adapted diagnostic criteria from the American National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (NIAID/FAAN), and developed a severity grading system that classified anaphylaxis into four grades. We recommended epinephrine as the first-line treatment, with specific doses and routes of administration for different severity of anaphylaxis or different conditions. Proper dosage is critical in the administration of epinephrine, and the monitor is important in the IV administration. Though there was only very low or low-quality evidence supported the use of glucocorticoids and H1 antagonists, we still weakly recommended them as second-line medications. We could not make a well-directed recommendation regarding premedication for preventing anaphylaxis since it is difficult to weigh the concerns and potential effects.

    "gold_answer": "Maternal health and nutritional status prior to conception can influence the long-term health outcomes of a child by shaping the intrauterine environment, which affects fetal development and has potential epigenetic impacts. This environment, influenced by maternal weight, diet, and physical activity, can predispose the child to risks such as obesity and diabetes later in life.",

Results This perspective highlights the varying methods used to estimate GWG and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. While these calculations could be argued to have a minimal impact on data at the population level, on the patient level, incorrectly estimating weight at conception can result in misclassification of preconception body mass index (BMI) and assignment of the IOM guidelines which inherently affect the prospective management of weight gain (and potential outcomes) during the current pregnancy. Conclusions We recommend that preconception BMI and total GWG be determined objectively and total GWG be adjusted for length of gestation before assessing adherence to the IOM GWG guidelines. Keywords: pregnancy, weight gain Introduction Obesity is a multifactorial widespread public and personal health concern. In Rodgers\u2019 (1) and Gilman\u2019s (2) call to action, they point to the impact the maternal environment has on a child\u2019s life long risk for obesity and diabetes. Fetal development and epigenetics are influenced by the metabolic and hormonal milieu of the intrauterine environment that is shaped by maternal weight status and driven by diet and physical activity. The intrauterine environment is believed to be formed well-before conception making maternal health prior to conception important in addition to prenatal health. These important points were elegantly illustrated by the work in Gambian women showing that DNA methylation established in the early embryo which is maintained in differentiated tissues was significantly affected by season of conception and maternal nutritional status (3). Maternal preconception obesity and gestational weight gain (GWG) both independently increase the risk for increased infant adiposity, childhood o"

JAMA. 2021. PMID: 34427621 Free PMC article. No abstract available. Abstract Importance: Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52 980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening. Objective: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies. Population: Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of know"

Undigested food components are metabolized to a diverse array of metabolites. Thus, what we eat shapes the structure, composition, and function of the gut microbiome, which interacts with the gut epithelium and mucosal immune system and maintains intestinal homeostasis in a healthy state. Alterations of the gut microbiome are implicated in many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). There is growing interest in nutritional therapy to target the gut microbiome in IBD. Investigations into dietary effects on the composition changes in the gut microbiome flourished in recent years, but few focused on gut physiology.

Editor\u2019s note: This article was updated on September 13, 2024, to remove references to the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccines and align with the latest COVID vaccination recommendations from the CDC. For the first time since 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its COVID isolation guidance. Specifically, it has shifted the recommendation that someone who tests positive for COVID isolate for five days to a timeline based on the progression of the person\u2019s symptoms. The update is part of a larger strategy to provide one set of recommendations for most common respiratory illnesses, including COVID, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In this Q&A, virologist Andy Pekosz, PhD, a professor in Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, explains the CDC\u2019s new isolation guidance, the reasons for the update, and why the prevention and treatment strategies we\u2019ve all become accustomed to still play an important part in reducing respiratory virus transmission. What are the updated recommendations for someone who comes down with a respiratory infection? The updated guidance from the CDC is to \u201cstay home and away from others (including people you live with who are not sick) if you have respiratory virus symptoms that aren't better explained by another cause.\u201d You can resume normal activities once your symptoms are improving and you\u2019ve been fever-free\u2014without the aid of fever-reducing medications\u2014for at least 24 hours. For the five days after you resume your normal activities, you should take extra precautions, like wearing a well-fitting mask and maintaining distance from others, gathering outdoors or in well-ventilated areas, cleaning hands and high-touch surfaces often, and testing when possible before gathering with others. If symptoms or fever return, you should start back at square one"

The more land managers know about the current migration patterns of these birds \u2013 and the migration patterns that are likely to develop in the future due to climate change \u2013 the better they can direct their efforts to protect the birds and to restore and conserve their habitats. This study brings them one step closer to that goal. The scientists analyzed 23 years of bird migration data collected via NOAA\u2019s Next Generation Radar system \u2013 a network of 143 radar stations across the continental U.S. \u2013",

Although it may present at any age however adolescence to early adults is the most common age of onset, and females are affected two times more in comparison to the males. Depressive disorders can occur as heterogeneous conditions in clinical scenario ranging from transient minor symptoms to severe and debilitating clinical conditions, causing severe social and occupational impairments. Usually, it presents with constellations of cognitive, emotional, behavioral, physiological, interpersonal, social, and occupational symptoms. The illness can be of various severities, and a significant proportion of the patients can have recurrent illness. Depression is also highly comorbid with several psychiatric and medical illnesses such as anxiety disorders, substance use, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular illnesses. Major depressive disorders accounted for around 8.2% global years lived with disability (YLD) in 2010, and it was the second leading cause of the YLDs. In addition, they also contribute to the burden of several other disorders indirectly such as suicide and ischemic heart disease.[1] EVIDENCE BASE FOR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IN DEPRESSION Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most evidence-based psychological interventions for the treatment of several psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorder, and substance use disorder. The uses are recently extended to psychotic disorders, behavioral medicine, marital discord, stressful life situations, and many other clinical conditions. A sufficient number of researches have been conducted and shown the efficacy of CBT in depressive disorders.

      "text": "Understanding Noise Exposure Limits: Occupational vs. General Environmental Noise Posted on byNoise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is 100% preventable; however, once acquired, it is permanent and irreversible [NIOSH 1998]. Understanding and minimizing the risks associated with noise exposures are the keys to preventing noise-related hearing loss. NIOSH has a long history of leadership in conducting research, advancing control measures, and recommending noise-exposure limits to prevent job-related hearing loss. Sometimes, observers ask whether our recommended limits for occupational exposure can be applied to exposures in the general environment from sources such as street noise, consumer appliances, and recreational pastimes. The answer, as we\u2019ll explain below, is not exactly. What is the NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit? NIOSH establishes recommended exposure limits (RELs) to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances and agents encountered in the workplace. These NIOSH limits are based on the best available science and practices. In 1998, NIOSH established the REL for occupational noise exposures to be 85 decibels, A-weighted (dB[A]) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. Exposures at or above this level are considered hazardous. The REL is based on exposures at work 5 days per week and assumes that the individual spends the other 16 hours in the day, as well as weekends, in quieter conditions. Importantly, the NIOSH REL is not a recommendation for noise exposures outside of the workplace in the general environment. NIOSH also specifies a maximum allowable daily noise dose, expressed in percentages. For example, a person continuously exposed to 85 dB(A) over an 8-hour work shift will reach 100% of their daily noise dose. This dose limit uses a 3-dB time-intensity tradeoff commonly referred to as the exchange rate or equal-energy rule: for every 3-dB increase in noise level, the allowable exposure time is reduced by half. For example, "

Unlike safety hazards that may lead to injury, health hazards can lead to various types of illness. For example, exposures to some chemicals used in work processes may cause immediate sensory irritation (e.g., stinging or burning eyes, dry throat, cough); in other cases, work\u00acplace chemicals may cause cancer in workers many years after exposure. There are millions of U.S. workers exposed to chemicals in their work each year. In order to make recommendations for working safely in the presence of chemical hazards, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducts risk assessments. In simple terms, risk assessment is a way of relating a hazard, like a toxic chemical in the air, to potential health risks associated with exposure to that hazard. R",

To develop prevention and enhance knowledge surrounding exposure, it has become crucial to achieve a consensus on how to assess exposure to airborne NPs by inhalation in the workplace. Here, we review the literature presenting recommendations on assessing occupational exposure to NPs. The 23 distinct strategies retained were analyzed in terms of the following points: target NPs, objectives, steps, \u201cmeasurement strategy\u201d (instruments, physicochemical analysis, and data processing), \u201ccontextual information\u201d presented, and \u201cwork activity\u201d analysis. The robustness (consistency of information) and practical aspects (detailed methodology) of each strategy were estimated.

Increasing emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels are causing changes in the ocean (see box). These changes can alter which species of marine life thrive best in certain areas. For example, many fish have shifted their typical range as water temperatures rise.2 However, other species are expected to decline in number or leave areas that are no longer favorable for them.3 These shifts can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and on fishing communities.4 Many climate change impacts will only be avoided by reducing carbon dioxide emissions.5",

This review is a first step toward assessing the possibility of causal relationships between nature and health in urban settings. Methods: Through systematic review of published literature, we explored the association between urban green space and human health. Results: We found consistent negative association between urban green space exposure and mortality, heart rate, and violence, and positive association with attention, mood, and physical activity.

Substantial and appropriate emphasis has been given to the strategies necessary for accurate measurement of blood pressure in any setting where valid blood pressure measurements are desired. Most \"errors\" made during blood pressure measurement bias readings upwards resulting in over-diagnosis of hypertension and, amongst those already on drug therapy, underestimating the true magnitude of blood pressure lowering resulting in over-treatment. Hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is consistently \u2265130 and/or \u226580 mm Hg. However, the majority of patients with hypertension between 130-139/80-89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate drug therapy. The guideline breaks new ground with some of its recommendations. Absolute cardiovascular risk is utilized, for the first time, to determine high-risk status when BP 130-139/80-89 mm Hg (Stage 1 hypertension) and high-risk patient characteristics/co-morbidities are absent including age 65 and older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, known cardiovascular disease; high-risk individuals initiate drug therapy when BP \u2265 130/80 mm Hg. The exception amongst high-risk individuals is for secondary stroke prevention in drug na\u00efve individuals as drug therapy is initiated when blood pressure \u2265140/90 mm Hg. Non-high risk individuals will initiate drug therapy when BP is \u2265140/90 mm Hg. Irrespective of blood pressure threshold for initiation of drug therapy, the target BP is minimally <130/80 mm Hg in most. However, target BP is <130 systolic amongst those 65 and older as the committee made no recommendation for a DBP target. Treatment should be initiated with two drug"

High sodium intake is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (both are linked to dementia), generating numerous recommendations for salt reduction to improve cardiovascular health. Objective: This systematic review aimed to assess, in middle- and older-aged people, the relationship between dietary sodium intake and cognitive outcomes including cognitive function, risk of cognitive decline, or dementia.

    "gold_answer": "Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations, essential for bone mineralization. Its deficiency can lead to thin, brittle, or misshapen bones, causing conditions such as rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Additionally, together with calcium, it helps protect older adults from osteoporosis.",

For information on vitamin D and COVID-19, see Dietary Supplements in the Time of COVID-19. Introduction Vitamin D (also referred to as calciferol) is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in a few foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. It is also produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis. Vitamin D obtained from sun exposure, foods, and supplements is biologically inert and must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation. The first hydroxylation, which occurs in the liver, converts vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], also known as calcidiol. The second hydroxylation occurs primarily in the kidney and forms the physiologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], also known as calcitriol [1]. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization and to prevent hypocalcemic tetany (involuntary contraction of muscles, leading to cramps and spasms). It is also needed for bone growth and bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts [1-3]. Without sufficient vitamin D, bones can become thin, brittle, or misshapen. Vitamin D sufficiency prevents rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Together with calcium, vitamin D also helps protect older adults from osteoporosis. Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as well as modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immune function, and glucose metabolism [1-3]. Many genes encoding proteins that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis are modulated in part by vitamin D. Many tissues have vitamin D receptors, and some convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D. In foods and dietary supplements, vitamin D has two main forms, D2 ("

These are achieved through immunomodulation and include anti-inflammatory actions, regulation of keratinocytes proliferation, and differentiation programs to build the epidermal barrier necessary for maintaining skin homeostasis. In addition, they induce antioxidative responses, inhibit DNA damage and induce DNA repair mechanisms to attenuate premature skin aging and cancerogenesis. The mechanism of action would involve interaction with multiple nuclear receptors including VDR, AhR, LXR, reverse agonism on ROR\u03b1 and -\u03b3, and nongenomic actions through 1,25D3-MARRS receptor and interaction with the nongenomic binding site of the VDR.

      "text": "More than 130 countries and international organizations have developed independent committees to approve or deny research that involves human subjects. These entities are often called institutional review boards (IRB), ethical review boards (ERB), independent ethics committees (IEC), or research ethics boards (REC) (USAID, 2018). The institutional review board (IRB) is a research ethics committee that reviews and approves human subjects\u2019 research. The IRB\u2019s primary responsibility is to protect research participants\u2019 rights, safety, and welfare, especially society\u2019s most vulnerable groups (i.e., prisoners, children, educationally/economically deprived, critically/terminally ill, and individuals with mental disabilities) (Gallin, 2018). This paper will briefly overview the IRB history and its role in the research process. History of Ethics Guidelines The Nuremberg Code is a vital document in the history of medical research ethics. The document was developed in August 1947 by American judges in response to the deadly and torturous human experiments conducted in the Auschwitz concentration camps during World War II by Nazi doctors. The Nuremberg Code is the first set of international ethical guidelines for human research, based on the Guidelines for Human Experimentation of 1931 (Ghooi, 2011). Moreover, it serves as a foundation for the principles that ensure the rights of study participants in medical research (Shuster, 1997). However, in the early years, the Nuremberg Code was ignored due to the connection with the prisoners in concentration camps. In addition, there was debate as to the applicability of the Code to medical research (Shuster, 1997). The principles of the Nuremberg Codes are: (\u201cThe Nuremberg Code (1947),\u201d 1996) The voluntary consent of the study participant is essential. The experiment should aim to yield results that benefit society and cannot be obtained in another way. The research should be based on previous knowledge (animal experiments, etc.). Th"

Subsequently, fluoride supplements were advocated for children whose water was not fluoridated, and now almost all toothpaste contains fluoride. The result is that multiple sources of fluoride, such as fluoridated toothpastes, fluoride supplements (drops and lozenges) and naturally occurring fluoride, have contributed to an increase in the incidence of fluorosis. The challenge is to provide the right amount of fluoride in a reliable and safe manner. Fluoride has been found to be effective in preventing caries but there have been no controlled studies to evaluate the optimal dose. The recommendations on fluoride use in a 1995 statement by the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) (2) differed substantially from those of the Canadian Dental Association (CDA). The position of the CDA (3) was that, apart from fluoride in water, the main source of fluoride should be",

      "text": "Abstract Objective The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, European Association of Poisons Centres, and Clinical Toxicologists recommend administration of activated charcoal (AC) within one-hour of an acute toxic ingestion [1]. Our poison control center periodically and upon request faxes an abbreviated protocol to hospital emergency departments, reminding physicians of these current AC recommendations. This study was conducted to describe how often patients present within the one-hour time frame and how often the guidelines in the above position statement are being followed. Methods Following a brief training of systematic chart review, reviewers blinded to the purpose of the study completed a standardized data collection sheet. Three years after publication of these consensus statements, a period of 3 consecutive years of poison center patient encounters were reviewed. Recorded data included age, outcomes, and time to administration of charcoal. Results Approximately 150,000 reported toxic exposures were reviewed, of which 16,914 patients of acute ingestions presented to a health care facility. The mean age of the group that presented was 25 years [range 1 month-87 years]. A total of 2,700 (16%) patients that presented were within 60 minutes of an acute overdose and all were administered AC in accordance with the recommended guidelines. Interestingly, pre-hospital personnel administered AC within 60 minutes to 762 (28% of 2,700) patients. Correspondingly, 14,214 (84%) patients presented more than 60 minutes after an acute overdose. Of this latter group AC was withheld in 341 (2.4% of 14,214) patients, and 13,873 (97.6% of 14,214) patients received charcoal despite having arrived more than 60 minutes after ingestion. The mean time to the first administration of AC in this latter group was 225 minutes [range of 61\u20132160 minutes] following ingestion. Conclusions Only a small percentage of patients treated for an acute overdose (16%) present within 60 minutes and "

Show detailsContinuing Education Activity Fluoxetine is an FDA-approved medication that has demonstrated efficacy in treating a spectrum of psychological conditions. These indications include major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, binge eating disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and bipolar depression, including cases of treatment-resistant depression when combined with olanzapine. The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of serotonin reuptake in presynaptic neurons, achieved by blocking the reuptake transporter protein. This activity provides insights into fluoxetine's indications, off-label uses, mechanism of action, dosing, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity. Objectives: - Identify potential indications for fluoxetine therapy based on evidence-based guidelines and patient-specific factors. - Screen patients for contraindications, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions before initiating fluoxetine therapy. - Apply evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate common side effects associated with fluoxetine, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and weight changes. - Select alternative treatment options or adjust dosages when necessary based on patient response, tolerability, drug interactions, and treatment-resistant symptoms.

      "text": "DEFINITION AND DESCRIPTION OF DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of differentorgans, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes. These range from autoimmune destruction of the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues. Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action. Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia. Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision. Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia. Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome. Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction. Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease. Hypertension and abnormalities of li"

Another 84 million are prediabetic, and without intervention, up to 70% of these individuals may progress to type 2 diabetes. Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes are limited by reliance on single-time-point measurements or on average measures of overall glycemia and neglect glucose dynamics. We have used continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to evaluate the frequency with which individuals demonstrate elevations in postprandial glucose, the types of patterns, and how patterns vary between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance and secretion highlights the fact that the physiology underlying dysglycemia is highly variable between individuals. We developed an analytical framewor",

Menopause, characterized by a decline in estrogen levels, heightens the risk of osteoporosis and sarcopenia, significantly affecting mobility and quality of life.

Adequate vitamin D and calcium intake is the cornerstone of osteoporosis prevention and treatment. Age-related changes in vitamin D and calcium metabolism increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Although longitudinal data have suggested a role of vitamin D intake in modulating bone loss in perimenopausal women, studies of vitamin D and calcium supplementation have failed to support a significant effect of vitamin D and calcium during early menopause. There is a clearer benefit in vitamin D and calcium supplementation in older postmenopausal women.

Developmental signs indicating readiness for this transition include the ability to sit up alone or with support, control of the head and neck, opening the mouth when food is offered, swallowing food rather than pushing it back out, bringing objects to the mouth, trying to grasp small objects, and transferring food from the front to the back of the tongue to swallow.",

Knowing when your child is ready for foods other than breast milk or infant formula Your child can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months. Introducing foods before 4 months is not recommended. Every child is different. You can look for these signs that your child is developmentally ready to begin eating food. Your child: - Sits up alone or with support. - Can control their head and neck. - Opens their mouth when you offer food. - Swallows food rather than pushes it back out onto their chin. - Brings objects to their mouth. - Tries to grasp small objects, such as toys or food. - Transfers food from the front to the back of their tongue to swallow. What foods to introduce first The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that for most children, you do not need to give food in a certain order. Your child can begin eating solid foods at about 6 months. By the time they are 7 or 8 months, your child can eat various foods from different food groups. These foods include: - Infant cereals - Meat or other proteins - Fruits - Vegetables - Grains - Yogurts - Cheeses If your child is eating infant cereals, offer a variety of fortified infant cereals such as oats, barley, and multigrain instead of only rice cereal. Only feeding your child infant rice cereal can increase their risk of arsenic exposure. How to introduce foods Let your child try one single-ingredient food at a time at first. This helps you see if your child has any problems, such as food allergies. Wait 3 to 5 days between each new food. Your child will soon be eating and enjoying many new foods. Introduce potentially allergenic foods when you introduce other foods. Potentially allergenic foods include: - Cow's milk products. - Eggs. - Fish and shellfish. - Tree nuts and peanuts. - Wheat, soy, and sesame. Drinking cow's milk"

Children are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution due to various physiological and behavioural factors. Children are at a higher risk of outcomes such as acute respiratory infections, asthma and decreased lung function due to air pollution exposure; the risk varies in different geographical regions, depending on the source of air pollution, duration of exposures and concentration. Prenatal exposure to air pollution may also contribute to adverse respiratory outcomes later in life. Short abstract Poor air quality is associated with adverse health impacts on children, including impaired lung growth and lower respiratory tract infections.

      "text": "Abstract The dietary intake of acrylamide (AA) is a health concern, and food is being monitored worldwide, but the extent of AA exposure from the diet is uncertain. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of estimated dietary intake. We performed a PubMed search identifying studies that used dietary questionnaires and recalls to estimate total dietary AA intake. A total of 101 studies were included, corresponding to 68 original study populations from 26 countries. Questionnaires were used in 57 studies, dietary recalls were used in 33 studies, and 11 studies used both methods. The estimated median AA intake ranged from 0.02 to 1.53 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day between studies. Children were represented in 25 studies, and the body-weight-adjusted estimated AA intake was up to three times higher for children than adults. The majority of studies were from Europe (n = 65), Asia (n = 17), and the USA (n = 12). Studies from Asia generally estimated lower intakes than studies from Europe and the USA. Differences in methods undermine direct comparison across studies. The assessment of AA intake through dietary questionnaires and recalls has limitations. The integration of these methods with the analysis of validated biomarkers of exposure/internal dose would improve the accuracy of dietary AA intake exposure estimation. This overview shows that AA exposure is widespread and the large variation across and within populations shows a potential for reduced intake among those with the highest exposure. Keywords: acrylamide, children, diet, epidemiological studies, humans, surveys and questionnaires 1. Introduction In 2002 it was discovered that acrylamide (AA) forms in foods during heating, especially in foods rich in carbohydrates [1]. AA forms from sugars and amino acids mainly through the Maillard reaction that \u2018browns\u2019 and affects the taste of food during high-temperature processing [2,3] (Figure 1). AA is classified as a \u2018probable human carcinogen\u2019, carcinogenicity Group"

Justification and evidence TB diagnosis in children relies on a thorough assessment of all evidence derived from a careful history of exposure, clinical examination and relevant investigations. While various algorithms and scoring systems for TB diagnosis in children exist, these have not been systematically evaluated. There is a need for evidence-based, practical treatment decision algorithm(s), ideally for different settings with varying access to diagnostic tests and CXR. PICO question: In children aged below 10 years with presumptive pulmonary TB attending health care facilities, should integrated treatment-decision algorithms be used to diagnose pulmonary TB, compared to a microbiological or composite reference standard? Evidence: To address the need for evaluating and developing evidence-based, integrated treatment decision algorithm(s), ideally for different settings with varying access to diagnostic tests and CXR, an individual participant dataset (IPD) meta-analysis was conducted. For this analysis, an IPD meta-cohort was developed, consisting of diagnostic evaluations data from children aged below 10 years, to infer the sensitivity and specificity of treatment-decision algorithms (or scores) in identifying pulmonary TB, using the updated clinical case definitions for the classification of intrathoracic TB among children (31). Data were requested from investigators in February 2021. Data for the IPD was sourced from several studies carried out within a geographically diverse set of TB high-burden countries. Algorithm sensitivity and specificity in classifying TB was evaluated against the Union Desk Guide Algorithm (32), which was developed in an attempt to operationalize the 2014 WHO guidance (8) by outlining the steps that a health care worker should take in evaluating a child with presumptive PTB.

Health education has been defined differently by various sources. The National Conference on Preventive Medicine in 1975 defined it as \"a process that informs, motivates, and helps people to adopt and maintain healthy practices and lifestyles, advocates environmental changes as needed to facilitate this goal, and conducts professional training and research to the same end.\"[4] The Joint Committee on Health Education and Promotion Terminology of 2001 defined Health Education as \"any combination of planned learning experiences based on sound theories that provide individuals, groups, and communities the opportunity to acquire information and the skills needed to make quality health decisions.\"[5] The World Health Organization (WHO) defined Health Education as consisting of \"consciously constructed opportunities for learning involving some form of communication designed to improve health literacy, including improving knowledge, and developing life skills which are conducive to individual and community health.\"[6] History [edit]It is often thought that health education began with the beginning of healthcare in the earliest parts of history as knowledge was passed from generation to generation.[7] Some people might be surprised to hear that health education's roots date back to the Greeks between the sixt"

Total Sugars Total Sugars include sugars naturally present in many nutritious foods and beverages, such as sugar in milk and fruits as well as any added sugars that may be present in the product. There is no Daily Value* for total sugars because no recommendation has been made for the total amount to eat in a day. 2. Added Sugars Added sugars include sugars that are added during the processing of foods (such as sucrose or dextrose), foods packaged as sweeteners (such as table sugar), sugars from syrups and honey, and sugars from concentrated fruit or vegetable juices. They do not include naturally occurring sugars that are found in milk, fruits, and vegetables. The Daily Value for added sugars is 50 grams per day based on a 2,000 calorie daily diet. For most Americans, the main sources of added sugars are sugar-sweetened beverages, baked goods, desserts, and sweets. Sample Label *The Daily Values are reference amounts (in grams, milligrams, or micrograms) of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day. Why Are Added Sugars Listed on the Nutrition Facts Label? The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting calories from added sugars to less than 10 percent of total calories per day. For example, if you consume a 2,000 calorie daily diet, that would be 200 calories or 50 grams of added sugars per day. Consuming too much added sugars can make it difficult to meet nutrient needs while staying within calorie limits. Added sugars are listed on the Nutrition Facts label so that you can make informed choices, based on your individual needs and preferences. How Are Added Sugars Listed on the Nutrition Facts Label?

One site calculated the sugar based on my daily calory intake, which isn't much at the moment, I am really small, really thin and not much muscles, being sedentary to lightly active at the moment (with the frozen streets I won't run or cycle, in a few weeks I will be more active again). So with a calory intake about 1600-1800 it gave me an allowance of 15g of added sugar. Which I wouldn't have much problem to stay under. It just really weirds me out about how it just counts added sugar. Eating a ripe banana has about this much sugar, but I shouldn't count it?

This review critically discusses the evidence supporting the effects of NNSs, both synthetic sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, neotame, advantame, and sucralose) and natural sweeteners (NSs; thaumatin, steviol glucosides, monellin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and glycyrrhizin) and nutritive sweeteners (polyols or sugar alcohols) on the composition of microbiota in the human gut.

However, many people have limited access to affordable, convenient places that offer healthier foods. This may include people living in lower-income urban neighborhoods, rural areas, and tribal communities, as well some racial and ethnic groups. In 2021, nearly 34 million U.S. residents lived in food insecure households. Healthy eating emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy, and lean protein.

    "gold_answer": "Conducting clinical research in phases is important because it allows researchers to systematically assess the safety, efficacy, and dosage of a new medical treatment. Each phase builds on the results of the previous one, starting with small groups to evaluate safety, then expanding to larger groups to assess effectiveness and monitor side effects, which ensures that any potential risks are identified and managed before the treatment is widely approved for public use.",

As the developers design the clinical study, they will consider what they want to accomplish for each of the different Clinical Research Phases and begin the Investigational New Drug Process (IND), a process they must go through before clinical research begins. On this page you will find information on: - Designing Clinical Trials Designing Clinical Trials Researchers design clinical trials to answer specific research questions related to a medical product. These trials follow a specific study plan, called a protocol, that is developed by the researcher or manufacturer. Before a clinical trial begins, researchers review prior information about the drug to develop research questions and objectives. Then, they decide: - Who qualifies to participate (selection criteria) - How many people will be part of the study - How long the study will last - Whether there will be a control group and other ways to limit research bias - How the drug will be given to patients and at what dosage - What assessments will be conducted, when, and what data will be collected - How the data will be reviewed and analyzed Clinical trials follow a typical series from early, small-scale, Phase 1 studies to late-stage, large scale, Phase 3 studies. What are the Clinical Trial Phases? Watch this video to learn about the three phases of clinical trials. Clinical Research Phase Studies Phase 1 Study Participants: 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or people with the disease/condition. Length of Study: Several months During Phase 1 studies, researchers test a new drug in normal volunteers (healthy people). In most cases, 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or people with the disease/condition participate in Phase 1. However, if a new drug is intended for us"

Although the beneficial effects of adequate nutritional status in pregnancy have been studied extensively over the last decade, many questions remain open, such as which are the most vulnerable periods of pregnancy, what are the effects of specific nutrients, and what levels of nutrients are required to improve cognitive development in the population.

Earlier studies which have investigated the association between nutrition and cognitive development have focused on individual micronutrients, including omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B12, folic acid, choline, iron, iodine, and zinc, and single aspects of diet. The research evidence from observational studies suggests that micronutrients may play an important role in the cognitive development of children. However, the results of intervention trials utilizing single micronutrients are inconclusive. More generally, there is evidence that malnutrition can impair cognitive development, whilst breastfeeding appears to be beneficial for cognition. Eating breakfast is also beneficial for cognition. In contrast, there is currently inconclusive evidence regarding the association between obesity and cognition.",

It contains important changes compared to earlier versions, and incorporates 387 new references (1). Here, we present an executive summary of this GOLD 2023 report (1) that (1) summarizes aspects that are relevant from a clinician\u2019s perspective and (2) updates evidence published since the prior executive summary in 2017. New Definition of COPD The definition of a disease should only include the characteristics that distinguish it from other diseases (2). Accordingly, GOLD 2023 proposes a new definition of COPD that, at variance with previous documents (3), focuses exclusively on these characteristics, separately from its epidemiology, causes, risk factors, and diagnostic criteria that are discussed on their own. GOLD 2023 defines COPD as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, and/or exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airways (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction. Pathogenesis: Causes and Risk Factors COPD results from dynamic, cumulative, and repeated gene (G) - environment (E) interactions over the lifetime (T) that damage the lungs and/or alter their normal development/aging processes (GETomics) (4). Environmental Risk Factors Cigarette smoking is a key environmental risk factor for COPD. Cigarette smokers have a higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities, a greater annual rate of FEV1 decline, and a greater COPD mortality rate than nonsmokers (5); yet fewer than 50% of heavy smokers develop COPD (6). Passive exposure to cigarette smoke, other types of tobacco smoke (e.g., pipe, cigar, water pipe) (7\u20139), and marijuana (10) are al"

REFERENCE DOSE (RfD): DESCRIPTION AND USE IN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS This concept paper describes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) principal approach to and rationale for assessing risk for health effects other than cancer and gene mutations from chronic chemical exposure. By outlining principles and concepts that guide EPA risk assessment for such systemic effects the paper complements the new risk assessment guidelines (U.S. EPA, 1987), which describe the Agency's approach to risk assessment in other areas, specifically carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental toxicity, exposure, and chemical mixtures. (In this document the term \"systemic toxicity\" refers to an effect other than carcinogenicity or mutagenicity induced by a toxic chemical.) Chemicals that give rise to toxic endpoints other than cancer and gene mutations are often referred to as \"systemic toxicants\" because of their effects on the function of various organ systems. In addition, chemicals that cause cancer and gene mutations also commonly evoke other toxic effects (i.e., systemic toxicity). Based on our understanding of homeostatic and adaptive mechanisms, systemic toxicity is treated as if there is an identifiable exposure threshold (both for the individual and for populations) below which there are no observable adverse effects.

A number of studies find that the price of nutritious food and the time cost to prepare foods are economically driven reasons for this relationship.

Low-income individuals have a higher burden of employment and food- and housing-related insecurity that threatens the livelihood of their household. Poverty and exposure to these insecurities are hypothesized to activate biobehavioral and psychological mechanisms\u2014endocrine, immune, and neurologic systems\u2014that influence food choice and consumption.

We first focus on the economic methodologies that are available for the evaluation of the effects (social costs and benefits) of environmental changes (degradation/preservation) on public health. Then, we explain how the monetary valuations of these effects can feed back in the construction of economic policy for creating agent-specific incentives for more efficient public health management, which is also equitable and environmentally sustainable.

However, at the time of writing, access to vaccines that prevent life-threatening infectious diseases remains unequal to all infants, children and adults in the world. This is a problem that many individuals and agencies are working hard to address globally. As clinicians and biomedical scientists we often focus on the health benefits that vaccines provide, in the prevention of ill-health and death from infectious pathogens. Here we discuss the health, economic and social benefits of vaccines that have been identified and studied in recent years, impacting all regions and all age groups.

Vaccination has been instrumental in eradicating important pathogens, including the smallpox virus and wild poliovirus types 2 and 3. This narrative review offers a detailed journey through the history and advancements in vaccinology, tailored for healthcare workers. It traces pivotal milestones, beginning with the variolation practices in the early 17th century, the development of the first smallpox vaccine, and the continuous evolution and innovation in vaccine development up to the present day.

This article will explore the process of freezing food, its effects on nutrients, and how to preserve the nutritional quality of your frozen produce. The Freezing Process: How It Works Before delving into the nutritional debate, it\u2019s essential to understand what actually happens during the freezing process. Freezing food involves lowering its temperature to below 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C), leading to the formation of ice crystals. This process halts the activity of microorganisms that cause spoilage, extending the food\u2019s shelf life. Stages of Freezing The freezing process can be broken down into several stages: - Pre-cooling: This is the initial stage where the food is cooled down, and surface moisture begins to freeze. -",

In order to help someone improve their wellness, it is equally important that health professionals are able to communicate how the interaction of different risk factors may contribute to a health issue. With the growing problem of obesity, for example, research shows a link to several mental health issues. In one meta-analysis, researchers found a clear association between ADHD and obesity in adults. In cases like these, health practitioners need to not only have an understanding of obesity but also know how issues like mental health and genetics impact weight gain. As more awareness builds around the complexity of our overall health, job prospects are increasing for health education specialists. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the expected job growth rate for health education specialists from 2022-32 is 7%, faster than the average rate of all occupations (2.8%). Health education specialists work in a variety of settings, including clinical health organizations, community/non-profit health organizations, government health agencies, colleges and universities, schools, and businesses/worksites. Becoming certified in the field can help health education specialists advance their careers and signify to potential employers that they have mastered key competencies for the profession. According to job market analysis tool Lightcast, job listings with the Certified Health Education Specialist credential have increased 254% from 2020 to 2023.

Show detailsContinuing Education Activity Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is one of the leading causes of death in the developed world. The prevalence of the disease approaches 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence when managing AMI. After participating in this activity, clinicians should proficiently identify signs and symptoms of AMI, assess severity and damage using diagnostic tests, apply evidence-based guidelines in AMI management, and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team for comprehensive care, narrowing the practice gap and improving competencies in the prompt recognition and effective management of acute myocardial infarction. Objectives: - Identify the signs and symptoms of acute myocardial infarction through comprehensive patient assessment and interpretation of diagnostic findings. - Assess the severity and extent of myocardial damage using diagnostic tests such as electrocardiography (ECG), cardiac biomarkers, and imaging modalities. - Apply evidence-based guidelines and best practices in the management of AMI, including pharmacological and interventional therapies. - Collaborate with a multidisciplinary healthcare team, including cardiologists, nurses, and rehabilitation specialists, to ensure comp"

In 2016, The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network launched the Asthma Follow up Integrated Care Initiative with the aim to reduce pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) presentations by 50% through developing and testing an integrated model of care led by care coordinators (CCs). Methods The integrated model of care was developed by a multidisciplinary team at Sydney Children's Hospital Randwick (SCH,R) and implemented in two phases: Phase I and Phase II. Children aged 2\u201316 years who presented \u22654 times to the ED of the SCH,R in the preceding 12 months were enrolled in Phase I and those who had \u22654 ED presentations and \u22651 hospital admissions with asthma attack were enrolled in Phase II.

CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens. Overview Finding and treating people with latent TB infection (sometimes called inactive TB for non-clinical audiences) is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection prevents TB disease. Treatment Considerations for Latent TB infection People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U.S. TB cases. Do not start latent TB infection treatment until TB disease is excluded. People with known risk factors for developing TB disease (once infected with TB bacteria) and have a positive TB blood test (interferon-gamma release assay or IGRA) result, or a tuberculin skin test (TB skin test) result should be given high priority for latent TB infection treatment. People with no known risk factors for TB may be considered for treatment of latent TB infection if they have either a positive IGRA result or if their reaction to the TB skin test is 15 mm or larger. Treatment Recommendations Health care providers may consider several recommended regimens for the treatment of latent TB infection. Treatment can take three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the regimen. Regimens use one or more of the following drugs: - Isoniazid (H) - Rifapentine (P) - Rifampin (R) CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens over 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Short-course regimens are effective, safe, and have higher completion rates than longer regimens. Treatment for latent TB infection can be administered by directly observed therapy ("

Altering the human gut microbiota may increase the predisposition to several disease phenotypes such as gut inflammation and metabolic disorders. The intestinal microbiota converts dietary nutrients into metabolites that serve as biologically active molecules in modulating regulatory functions in the host. Probiotics, which are active microorganisms, play a versatile role in restoring the composition of the gut microbiota, helping to improve host immunity and prevent intestinal disease phenotypes. This comprehensive review provides firsthand information on the gut microbiota and their influence on human health, the dietary effects of diet on the gut microbiota, and how probiotics alter the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, along with their corresponding effects on host immunity in building a healthy intestine.

Eritrean armed forces and Amhara Regional Forces, both with longstanding grievances against Tigrayans, joined to back the Ethiopian government. Alarming levels of violence against civilians appear to indicate the operations intend not only to wipe out the Tigrayan government, but also the people of Tigray. Global leaders have called it ethnic cleansing. Human rights violations and atrocities \u2013 including mass killings, rapes, lootings and weaponized aid \u2013 are rampant. Reports show Eritrean armed forces and Amhara Regional Forces are responsible for the worst abuses, though the UN Human Rights Office has named all actors, including the Ethiopian National Defense Forces, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front, and affiliated militia as culprits. Despite Ethiopia\u2019s government announcing it had called a unilateral cease-fire in the region, fighting remains rampant. Sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war against Tigrayan women and children \u2013 a grave violation of human rights that traumatizes the survivor, destabilizes entire communities and inflicts harm over generations. - More than 829 cases of sexual assault have been officially reported since the conflict began, and the conservative estimated number of survivors of rape in Tigray is 10,000. Nearly a quarter of reports received by one agency involve gang rape with victims as young as eight years old. In May 2021, more than 500 cases of gender-based violence, including rape, were officially reported. - Doctors across Ethiopia and in Sudanese refugee camps have reported a surge in demand for emergency contraception and testing for sexually transmitted infections, as many women have contracted sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. - A Rapid Gender Analysis conducted by the International Rescue Committee found evidence of wid"

Since then, we\u2019ve experienced influenza pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009, and another influenza pandemic will happen. However, pandemic influenza is not our only concern. Every year, seasonal influenza results in up to one billion cases and 290,000-650,000 respiratory-related deaths worldwide. While these figures demonstrate substantial morbidity and mortality due to seasonal influenza, they do not account for the full impact on society and health systems (i.e. loss of productivity and cost of hospitalisations). Additionally, novel zoonotic influenza viruses, such as avian influenza H7N9, continue to emerge and remind us that a pandemic is always on the horizon. COVID-19 has exposed critical gaps in global preparedness and will prompt stakeholders from all sectors to develop and strengthen resilient systems to combat infectious diseases, including influenza. Influenza will continue to pose a threat in a post-COVID-19 world, and we must remain vigilant for the next influenza pandemic. Global assets supporting influenza preparedness Fortunately, the global community has been improving influenza preparedness, particularly since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and our collective preparedness relies on two global assets. WHO\u2019s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which was established about 70 years ago, serves as the backbone to global influenza preparedness.

      "text": "The Long History of mRNA Vaccines Messenger RNA, or mRNA, was discovered in the early 1960s; research into how mRNA could be delivered into cells was developed in the 1970s. So, why did it take until the global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 for the first mRNA vaccine to be brought to market? In this explainer, Chris Beyrer talks us through mRNA vaccines\u2019 history, development, and breakthroughs. There\u2019s a big gap between when the first mRNA flu vaccine was tested in mice in the 1990s and when the first mRNA vaccines for rabies were tested in humans in 2013. What was happening in the interim? The early years of mRNA research were marked by a lot of enthusiasm for the technology but some difficult technical challenges that took a great deal of innovation to overcome. The biggest challenge was that mRNA would be taken up by the body and quickly degraded before it could \u201cdeliver\u201d its message\u2014the RNA transcript\u2014and be read into proteins in the cells. The solution to this problem came from advances in nanotechnology: the development of fatty droplets (lipid nanoparticles) that wrapped the mRNA like a bubble, which allowed entry into the cells. Once inside the cell, the mRNA message could be translated into proteins, like the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and the immune system would then be primed to recognize the foreign protein. So, what happened once they figured out this technology? The first mRNA vaccines using these fatty envelopes were developed against the deadly Ebola virus, but since that virus is only found in a limited number of African countries, it had no commercial development in the U.S. Then COVID-19 hit \u2026 what happened then? Remember, the COVID-19 pandemic spurred manufacturers to develop dozens of potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and brought tremendous increases in funding. Some of those vaccines used traditional methods involving adenovirus as the spike protein delivery system\u2014such as the Johnson & Johnson vector vaccine. Thanks to decades of research an"

Most of the greenhouse gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere come from burning fossil fuels to produce energy, mainly for electricity and heat. In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions must be reduced by almost half by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050. To achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. Renewable energy sources \u2014 such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth \u2014 are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants.

Generation capacity has grown rapidly in recent years, driven by policy support and sharp cost reductions for solar photovoltaics and wind power in particular. What is the role of renewables in clean energy transitions? The deployment of renewables in the power, heat and transport sectors is one of the main enablers of keeping the rise in average global temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C. In the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, renewables allow electricity generation to be almost completely decarbonised.

Although the storm weakened slightly during the final hours of its approach, Mocha still brought dangerous winds, downpours, and storm surge when it made landfall just north of Sittwe, Myanmar. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite captured this natural-color image of the cyclone at 07:15 Universal Time (1:45 p.m. local time) on May 14, 2023, as the storm neared landfall. The storm underwent a period of rapid intensification on May 14 as it encountered warm water in the Bay of Bengal and little vertical wind shear\u2014factors that can strengthen tropical cyclones. At their peak, Mocha\u2019s powerful winds tied with Cyclone Fani for being the strongest on record in the North Indian Ocean basin, according to Jeff Masters with Yale Climate Connections. To estimate storm intensity, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses the Dvorak technique, which is based on an analysis of cloud patterns in visible and infrared imagery from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites. Early reports suggest the storm caused widespread damage in Sittwe, the state capital of Rakhine, with local news sources reporting flooded streets, downed trees and power lines, and roofs torn from homes. The evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from vulnerable areas in both Bangladesh and Myanmar in advance of the storm may have helped limit casualties, according to some news reports. The worst of the storm surge also missed low-lying refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar that many observers feared were vulnerable. However, aid groups also report that telecommunication interruptions have made it difficult to assess the full impact of the storm. \u201cEarly reports suggest the damage is extensive and needs among already vulnerable communities, particularly displaced people, will be high,\u201d the United Nations Office for the Co"

Between 1950 and 2020, the average pH of the ocean surface fell from approximately 8.15 to 8.05.[2] Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are the primary cause of ocean acidification, with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels exceeding 422 ppm (as of 2024[update]).[3] CO2 from the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This chemical reaction produces carbonic acid (H2CO3) which dissociates into a bicarbonate ion (HCO\u22123) and a hydrogen ion (H+). The presence of free hydrogen ions (H+) lowers the pH of the ocean, increasing acidity (this does not mean that seawater is acidic yet; it is still alkaline, with a pH higher than 8). Marine calcifying organisms, such as mollusks and corals, are especially vulnerable because they rely on calcium carbonate to build shells and skeletons.[4] A change in pH by 0.1 represents a 26% increase in hydrogen ion concentration in the world's oceans (th",

Devolution meant that the four nations' administrative responses to the pandemic differed; the Scottish Government, the Welsh Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive produced different policies to those that apply in England. Numerous laws were enacted or introduced throughout the crisis. The UK government had developed a pandemic response plan in previous years. In response to the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in January 2020, the UK introduced advice for travellers coming from affected countries in late January and February 2020, and began contact tracing, although this was later abandoned.[1] The government incrementally introduced further societal restrictions on the public as the virus spread across the country in the following weeks, initially resisting more stringent measures introduced elsewhere in Europe and Asia.[2] Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the first national lockdown on 23 March 2020 and Parliament introduced the Coronavirus Act 2020, which granted the devolved governments emergency powers and empowered the police to enforce public health measures.[3] As the governments began lifting the nationwide stay-at-home order, policies and approaches diverged between the four nations.

Micron has also pledged to fund local child care, achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and spend millions on other community investments.\" And, before the company even breaks ground, the community is already seeing tangible benefits such as \"increased residential and commercial development,\" expanded public transit, and colleges \"adding degrees and training programs to seed a semiconductor workforce.\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra credited the CHIPS and Science Act \u2013 which President Biden signed into law this past August \u2013 as being directly responsible for Micron's investment in New York, saying in a statement that \"there is no doubt that without the CHIPS Act, we would not be here today.\" For Dodge, what is critical about this investment is that it rejects the failed trickle-down policies for a new economic approach: Bidenomics. Bidenomics is rooted in the simple idea that we need to grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up\u2014not the top down. \"This approach recognizes that when it comes to growth and opportunity, the question is not just how much, but where and for whom.

A team of researchers led by the Animal Breeding and Genomics group (ABG) of Wageningen University & Research (WUR) has published a landmark review on a technology often associated with physics labs and encryption: quantum computing.

Climate change is making weather patterns unpredictable, global supply chains are struggling with inefficiencies, and the need for higher crop yields is greater than ever. Traditional computing methods help farmers manage these issues to some extent, but they often fall short when dealing with highly complex agricultural systems. Enter quantum computing\u2014a technology that has the potential to revolutionize farming by solving problems that today\u2019s supercomputers struggle with. What is Quantum Computing? Unlike classical computers, which process information in binary (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once. This allows quantum computers to perform calculations exponentially faster than traditional systems. In simple terms, while a classical computer solves one problem at a time, a quantum computer can explore multiple solutions simultaneously, making it ideal for solving complex, data-heavy",

At the end of 2018, in France, the increase in the fuel tax caused the outbreak of the Yellow Vests protest movement . The movement presented itself as spontaneous, horizontal and directionless. Massive demonstrations every Saturday, blockades of roundabouts, calls through social networks and the request for the resignation of President Emmanuel Macron . Today, five years later, with the pension reform law , the same president is once again facing the same ghosts, a spectacular protest movement that, due to its intensity, is already the largest in the last 40 years. But this new movement is not only superior in quantity, but also, and above all, in quality. Its social base springs from the factories, from poor students, from lower-class homes, from the heart of the working class . And it is organized with its methods, the assemblies , and with one of its main institutions, the unions . A new movement that openly questions capitalism and its institutions, that encompasses all generations and that, unlike the yellow vests, has the real capacity to mobilize and completely stop the country. Sometimes organized, sometimes spontaneous, it can be put into action any day of the month and extend for days and weeks. Because of its remarkable superiority,It will not take long for it to spread to the whole of Europe, just as it did with the Yellow Vest movement . This report is a continuation of a previous one: \"The French working people lead the way\" , from 03/06/23 . In that one we explained what the pension reform law is about and we stressed the importance of the call for the sixth day of strike for March 7.

The initial images downlinked after the historic event show an intact sample present in the tube after coring. However, additional images taken after the arm completed sample acquisition were inconclusive due to poor sunlight conditions. Another round of images with better lighting will be taken before the sample processing continues. Obtaining additional imagery prior to proceeding with the sealing and storing of Mars rock sample is an extra step the team opted to include based on its experience with the rover\u2019s sampling attempt on Aug. 5. Although the Perseverance mission team is confident that the sample is in the tube, images in optimal lighting conditions will confirm its presence. Perseverance\u2019s Sampling and Caching System uses a rotary-percussive drill and a hollow coring bit at the end of its 7-foot-long (2-meter-long) robotic arm to extract samples slightly thicker than a pencil. Within the bit during coring is a sample tube. After completing yesterday\u2019s coring, Perseverance maneuvered the corer, bit, and open end of the sample tube in order to be imaged by the rover\u2019s Mastcam-Z instrument. The target for the sample collection attempt was a briefcase-size rock belonging to a ridgeline that is more than half-a-mile (900 meters) long and contains rock outcrops and boulders.

Except that isn't quite the full story. Beyond a certain size, solar farms become large enough to affect the weather around them and ultimately the climate as a whole. In our new research we have looked at the effect such climate-altering solar farms might have on solar power production elsewhere in the world. We know that solar power is affected by weather conditions and output varies through the days and seasons. Clouds, rain, snow and fog can all block sunlight from reaching solar panels. On a cloudy day, output can drop by 75%, while their efficiency also decreases at high temperatures. In the long term, climate change could affect the cloud cover of certain regions and how much solar power they can generate. Northern Europe is likely to see a solar decrease for instanc",

      "text": "Canada convoy protest (Freedom Convoy 2022) The Freedom Convoy 2022 refers to a significant protest movement in Canada that began in late January 2022, initially sparked by the federal government's mandate requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for essential workers, including cross-border truck drivers. Despite a high vaccination rate among truckers, opposition to the mandate led to the organization of a large convoy of trucks descending on Ottawa, where demonstrators occupied the downtown area for approximately three weeks, demanding the removal of all federal vaccine mandates. The protest garnered extensive media coverage and drew both support and criticism from the public, with some viewing it as a legitimate expression of dissent while others labeled it as driven by extremist elements, particularly after reports of controversial symbols appearing among some protesters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau characterized the participants as a \"fringe minority\" and refused to engage with them, which intensified public discourse on the protest\u2019s implications. The government eventually invoked the Emergencies Act to clear the protests, a move that faced significant backlash and concerns regarding civil liberties. Although the Freedom Convoy reverberated beyond Canadian borders, inspiring similar protests in other countries, its impact on Canadian society and politics continues to be debated, especially regarding government responses to dissent and public health measures. The events surrounding the convoy have sparked ongoing discussions about leadership, civil rights, and the balance between public health and individual freedoms in Canada. On this Page Canada convoy protest (Freedom Convoy 2022) On January 15, 2022, the Canadian federal government began enforcing a rule that expanded its mandate for COVID-19 vaccinations to include all essential workers whose duties involve crossing the Canada-US border.

      "text": "Dear Editor, The WHO designated the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, as the number of cases swiftly increased across the globe1. The pandemic has affected the global community, including public health, the economy, education, and mental health. The implementation of laws that prohibit gatherings and promote social distancing has also had an impact on our social lives2. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in more than 765 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 6.9 million associated deaths as of 3 May 20233. The situation has changed. The impact of COVID-19 has begun to diminish, and the hospitalization rate and admission to intensive care units have decreased consistently. The WHO was receiving significantly fewer surveillance reports from countries. More people are now vaccinated worldwide which reduces the risk to global public health. In addition, the virulence of the currently circulating coronavirus is substantially more consistent than that of its predecessor. Despite the constant evolution of SARS-CoV-2, clinical case management has also made significant strides in recent years. The currently circulating mutations do not appear to be associated with a disease progression. As of 3 May 2023, 89% of health personnel and 82% of individuals over 60 have received vaccinations3. The WHO announced that after more than a year of analyzing data, International Health Regulations Emergency Committee (IHREC) recommended that they take initiatives to end the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 5 May 2023, the WHO declared that COVID-19 is no longer a PHEIC4. This does not imply that the virus is no longer a menace to global public health. The virus is still killing people around the globe, and there is always a chance that new variants will emerge and cause new cases and fatalities. The WHO will now transfer its focus from an emergency response to managing COVID-19 alongside other infecti"

The first two quakes had the most severe impact, with 1,950 injuries and 1,480 fatalities reported. These events directly affected around 43,400 individuals in six regions, destroying 3,330 homes and causing damage to approximately 21,300 buildings, including vital infrastructure (1).

A high-profile recent example is the border security bill. This proposal was assembled largely and apparently with very significant effort by assigned members of a party at their own party's request, negotiated to gather bipartisan support, and then voted against by the same party that initiated it, ostensibly for political reasons.\n\nThe topic here explores how much this inability prevents the United States from effectively gove",

Three future periods affected by the two projections on CC (SRES A1B and A2) were considered and compared against historic ((1961-1990) figures. The impact on wheat was simulated with the CropSyst model distinguishing three levels of agronomic management.

Countries with rich REEs deposits have become pivotal players in the industry and essential elements of international supply chains. However, the complex nature of the supply chain and the high degree of secrecy surrounding trade practices make it hard to track the origin and quality of REEs. This lack of transparency increases the risks of supply chain disruptions and makes it challenging to achieve sustainability goals within the industry. This article explores the state of the rare earth (RE) industry, namely: - The significance of REEs in the development and operation of modern and emerging technologies. - The role and environmental impact of the extraction and production of REEs. - The influence of regulations and certifications in the RE industry and how they can drive sustainability and transparency in REE supply chains. - The strategies fo",

    "gold_answer": "Geopolitical interests and regional tensions complicate the peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan by introducing external influences and conflicting agendas. Russia plays a central role by overseeing negotiations and pursuing its interests, while Armenia faces domestic opposition and Iran seeks to assert its strategic ambitions in the region.

However, the path towards a comprehensive peace accord still needs to be solved with some challenges. The unresolved status of Nagorno-Karabakh and the fate of its Armenian inhabitants remain critical points of contention. Additionally, the difficulties of Armenian Prime Minister Nicol Pashinyan in executing provisions related to the proposed transportation corridors outlined in the Ceasefire Pact add another layer of discord. External actors further complicated this situation. Armenia's domestic opposition and Iran's strategic ambitions within the region played significant roles. Conversely, Russia has taken a central role in overseeing peace negotiations and advancing its interests in the Southern Caucasus. This article delves into the entrenched disputes between Azerbaijan and Armenia and examines the potential trajectory of their relations. Moreover, it provides insights into Russia's intricate agenda, which shapes the evolving dynamics of the Southern Caucasus region. In essence, this study analyzes the intricate web of challenges, interests, and influences that intersect in this geopolitical landscape, shedding light on the intricate interplay between internal and external factors.

Among them, Talim was the first tropical cyclone affecting Hong Kong in 2023. The Observatory issued the first No. 8 Gale or Storm Signal in 2023 during the passage of Talim. Talim formed as a tropical depression over the central part of the South China Sea about 490 km southeast of Dongsha on the morning of 14 July. It moved westwards at first and intensified gradually. Talim intensified into a tropical storm and entered the northern part of the South China Sea the next day. Talim turned to move west-northwestwards that night and continued to edge towards the coast of western Guangdong. Talim intensified further into a typhoon on the night of 16 July and attained its peak intensity with an estimated maximum sustained wind of 140 km/h near its centre on the morning of 17 July. Talim made landfall near Zhanjiang, Guangdong that night, and moved across Leizhou Peninsula and Beibu Wan the next morning. It moved into inland Guangxi on 18 July and degenerated into an area of low pressure over the northern part of Vietnam the next morning. According to press reports, one person was injured when Talim affected Macao. There were also 30 incident reports, including fallen trees and scaffoldings. Besides, Talim also brought torrential rain and squalls to many places in Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan. For detailed information of Talim including its impact to Hong Kong, please refer to the Tropical Cyclone Report of Talim. Doksuri formed as a tropical depression over the western North Pacific about 1 270 km east of Manila on the night of 20 July. It moved north-northwestwards and intensified gradually.

The NAC flows northward east of the Grand Banks, from 40\u00b0N to 51\u00b0N, before turning sharply east to cross the Atlantic. It transports more warm tropical water to northern latitudes than any other boundary current; more than 40 Sv (40 million m3/s; 1.4 billion cu ft/s) in the south and 20 Sv (20 million m3/s; 710 million cu ft/s) as it crosses the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.

On August 14, 2024, following a regional declaration by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization declared mpox a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, marking the second such declaration in two years. A series of outbreaks involving the more virulent clade I virus (compared to clade II, which caused a global outbreak in 2022), has now spread in 13 African countries, exposing the inadequacies of the public health infrastructure in these settings. There was significant investment during the 2022 global outbreak, but these efforts failed to address vaccine access and treatment in the Global South. Regulatory delays, unequal access to vaccines, and a lack of compassionate use treatments for severe cases have resulted in preventable cases and deaths, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, children, and the immunocompromised. The current outbreak also underscores critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of mpox, including its transmission, pathogenesis, and viral evolution. We join intensified calls for global solidarity and action to control mpox, emphasizing immediate containment measures and long-term local and international investment in African public health systems, to prevent future epidemics. On August 14, 2024, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current mpox outbreak a global Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).1 This marks the second mpox PHEIC declared by the WHO in the past two years, which followed the regional emergency declaration by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) on August 13, 2024.2 These declarations expose major gaps in mpox vaccine and drug access, as well as in understanding the natural history of the disease, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, viral evolution, immune responses, and underlying risk factors that fuel outbreaks and sustain transmission.

Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified.

      "text": "On March 10, 2023, a presidential decision invoking the president\u2019s power to call for early elections under article 116 of the Constitution of Turkey was published in the Official Gazette. The presidential decision was followed by two decisions of the Supreme Election Board (SEB) setting the election dates and the latest date by which holders of certain public offices who seek to run for membership of the parliament must resign or retire from their posts, in accordance with the Law on Parliamentary Elections. The SEB, which is the constitutional body responsible for regulating and supervising all public elections in the country under article 79 of the Constitution, decided that the parliamentary and presidential elections will take place on May 14, 2023. A presidential runoff election will take place on May 28, 2023, if necessary. Presidential Election Under article 101 of the Constitution, the president of the republic is elected in a general election with a simple majority of all valid ballots cast. If no candidate gets a majority, a runoff election is to be held between the two candidates who have received the most votes. Article 116 of the Constitution provides that both the president of the republic and the unicameral parliament by a three-fifths vote of its members may call for early elections (\u201crenewal of elections\u201d). The electoral term for both the membership of the parliament and the president is five years, and the ordinary rule requires both elections to be held on the same day \u2014 the last Sunday preceding the elapse of five years from the date on which the previous elections were held. The last parliamentary and presidential elections were held on June 24, 2018. Accordingly, the elections would have taken place on June 18, 2023, had the president not called for early elections.

June 7, 2022U.S. scientists and collaborators have a powerful new instrument at their disposal\u2014the world\u2019s first exascale supercomputer. The international Top500 list of most powerful systems in the world named the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science system Frontier the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer. Frontier broke the exascale limit, reaching 1.1 exaflops of performance on the High-Performance Linpack benchmark. Exascale performance is measured by calculations faster than 1018 floating point operations per second (flops), or a quintillion calculations per second. Located at DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Frontier is a collaboration between DOE and U.S. technology companies HPE and AMD. This milestone marks the beginning of the long-awaited exascale era, following more than 10 years of research and development by the nation\u2019s brightest minds\u2014not only for Frontier but other upcoming DOE exascale systems. Exascale systems will provide the next-generation of computing desperately needed for the massive number crunching required for climate change research and prediction, materials design for energy technologies and fusion reactors, a stronger and more adaptive power grid, the data-driven design of new COVID treatments, rapid data analysis for scientific facilities such as light sources, and many other challenges in energy, environment, and national security. As Associate Director of the DOE Office of Science\u2019s Advanced Scientific Computing Research program, I lead programs and facilities that accelerate scientific research with top-notch computing resources. Computing has become an integral part of scientific research and each year the demand for our computing resources grows.

      "text": "On Sept. 28, Hurricane Ian made landfall near Cayo Costa in southwestern Florida as a dangerous, high-end Category 4 storm after plowing a path of destruction through the Caribbean, bringing particularly heavy rainfall and dangerous surf to Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and western Cuba. After crossing over the Florida peninsula, where it had weakened to a tropical storm, it strengthened again over the water to a Category 1 hurricane and made a second landfall near Georgetown, South Carolina. Tropical Storm Ian first formed in the central Caribbean on Sept. 23 and strengthened into a hurricane on Sept. 26. With maximum winds of 105 mph, it became the strongest September hurricane in this region of the Caribbean (west of 75 degrees west) since Hurricane Felix in 2007. As it transitioned into a hurricane, Ian officially met the National Hurricane Center\u2019s threshold for \u201crapid intensification\u201d\u2014gaining at least 35 miles per hour in wind speeds within 24 hours or less. As Ian headed north-northwestward, it continued to quickly intensify over the warm waters and emerged in the southern Gulf of Mexico as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph during the night of Sept 26 into the morning of Sept 27\u2014the strongest September hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Irma in 2017. Ian intensified faster than any other hurricane this Atlantic season. Ian made landfall that day near La Coloma in the Pinar Del Rio Province in western Cuba, battering the area with high winds, a life-threatening storm surge, and knocking out the island\u2019s power grid. The hurricane then headed toward Florida\u2019s western coast, where residents of coastal communities were ordered to evacuate. On the morning of Sept. 28, Ian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph, just shy of a Category 5 storm. Ian came ashore near Cayo Costa, Florida, at 3:05 p.m. EDT with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph, tying the record fo"

This diversity is affected by various factors, especially physical elements like Ocean Currents and geographic features. Understanding how these factors influence where different species are found and how communities are formed is crucial for conservation efforts. Research indicates that communities of tiny marine organisms called Plankton become more similar as ocean currents connect them. This means that the farther apart they are geographically, the less similar they tend to be. Even though scientists have looked into how ocean conditions affect the movement of these organisms for a long time, there is still a lack of studies focusing on local ocean currents and how they contribute to patterns of marine biodiversity.

II. Historical Context and Research Overview Interest in how weather influences voter turnout dates back decades. Early empirical studies identified patterns showing rain and adverse weather tend to reduce voter participation. For example, Gomez et al.

Researchers found that people exposed to higher than average temperatures were significantly more likely to express a preference for left-leaning political parties when surveyed and they also became more anxious about the effects of climate change. The data also showed that the effects of higher temperatures on political preference and climate anxiety were particularly acute among older voters and persisted for up to three years. With the increasing frequency of extreme temperatures, however, researchers believe the effect may become increasingly important .

Read more about the scope and implications of Europe\u2019s pending Digital Services Act for technology firms. On April 23, 2022, the trifecta of European Union (EU) institutions, namely the European Commission, the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, reached an agreement on the text of the Digital Services Act (DSA), proposed by the Commission in December 2020 to replace the E-Commerce Directive of 2000. The DSA\u2019s goal is to get online platforms to regulate illegal content, hate speech, disinformation, and false advertisement more effectively, or in simple words, to make \u201cwhat is illegal offline illegal online.\u201d Asha Allen, Advocacy Director for Europe, Online Expression & Civic Space for the Centre of Democracy and Technology, summarizes its objectives as \u201cincreased algorithmic and content moderation transparency, extensive due diligence obligations, and risk assessment and mitigation measures.\u201d The DSA marks what one commentator calls a shift away from the 20-year paradigm of online self-regulation. To be more precise, it asks companies to become much more proactive about understanding, explaining and mitigating risks generated by their business decisions and threatens to impose penalties if they fail to do so. Daphne Keller, preeminent expert in intermediary liability, argues that Europe\u2019s model of knowledge-based platform liability for illegal content has been in place for decades, but the Act adds new processes and regulatory rules. Combined with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in 2018, the Digital Market Act, a bill in the final stages of the legislative process that seeks to bolster competition in a digital market dominated by a few powerful companies, and the proposed Artificial Intelligence "

But just beyond a black hole\u2019s point of no return, light persists, and its patterns, like a photo negative, can reveal a black hole\u2019s lurking presence. Now an international team of astronomers, including researchers at MIT\u2019s Haystack Observatory, has captured the light around our own supermassive black hole, revealing for the first time, an image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*, pronounced \u2018sadge-ay-star\u2019), the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way galaxy. The image was created by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) \u2014 a global network of radio telescopes whose movements are choreographed so they function as one virtual, planet-sized telescope. The researchers focused the EHT array on the center of our galaxy, 27,000 light years from Earth, cutting through our planet\u2019s atmosphere and the turbulent plasma beyond our solar system. The resulting image reveals Sgr A* for the first time, in the form of a glowing, donut-shaped ring of light. This ring structure lies just outside the event horizon, or the point beyond which light cannot escape, and is the result of light being bent by the black hole\u2019s enormous gravity. The bright ring encircles a dark center, described as the black hole\u2019s \u201cshadow.\u201d The ring\u2019s white-hot plasma is estimated to be 10 billion Kelvin, or 18 billion degrees Fahrenheit. Judging from the ring\u2019s dimensions, Sgr A* is roughly 4 million times the mass of the sun and incredibly compact, with a size that could fit within the orbit of Venus. The image is the first visual confirmation that a black hole indeed exists at the center of our galaxy. Astronomers previously have observed stars circling around an invisible, massive, and extremely dense object \u2014 all signs pointing to a supermassive black hole.

During 2020, LPAI H9N2 virus infection in one child with moderate illness after possible indirect exposure to backyard poultry was reported from Hong Kong in February 2020. Senegal reported a case of LPAI H9N2 virus infection in a child with mild illness after backyard poultry exposure that occurred in February 2019. During 2020, China reported five cases of LPAI H9N2 virus infection in four children and one adult who experienced mild illness and were detected through ILI surveillance. 2021 In March 2021, there were reports of HPAI H5N8 virus in seals in the United Kingdom, Germany4, and Denmark. Several subtypes of avian influenza viruses (H7N756, H4N57, H4N68, H3N38 and H10N79) have caused epidemics in seals. In March 2021, Laos reported its first human infection with HPAI H5N6 in a child who first became mildly ill in February following contact with infected poultry.

In a NASA-led study published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, scientists have linked this variability to large-scale climate patterns originating thousands of miles away. Migratory birds benefit ecosystems by helping to control pests, pollinating plants and serving as food for other wildlife. The more land managers know about the current migration patterns of these birds \u2013 and the migration patterns that are likely to develop in the future due to climate change \u2013 the better they can direct their efforts to protect the birds and to restore and conserve their habitats. This study brings them one step closer to that goal. The scientists analyzed 23 years of bird migration data collected via NOAA\u2019s Next Generation Radar system \u2013 a network of 143 radar stations across the continental U.S. \u2013",

Effective conservation of migratory birds depends on a clear understanding of how environmental factors affect key demographic rates (e.g., survival and reproduction). This informational need is especially pressing in the context of climate change. Climate change is expected to affect migratory bird habitat and populations in multiple ways, and a mechanistic understanding of how demographic rates are related to climate variables will help land and resource managers to better anticipate and manage these changes. The Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) is addressing this question by using data from the Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) program, the longest running continent-wide monitoring program to provide information on migratory bird demographics (recruitment, survival, immigration, and emig",

This goal was originally set out in the European Green Deal in December 2019. In addition, as an intermediate goal, the European Climate Law sets a total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. On July 14, 2021, the European Commission presented a series of legislative proposals, the \u201cFit for 55 package,\u201d which describes the measures the Commission will take to reach the 2030 target. An EU regulation has general application. It is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the EU member states. (Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) art. 288, para. 2.) Background to European Environmental Policies In October 2016, the EU ratified the Paris Agreement, which sets out the goal of keeping global temperature increases to below 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial level. In furtherance of that goal, the EU submitted an updated and enhanced \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2020, in which it set a net domestic GHG emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

Sondland said the connection between these two issues was widely known throughout the administration. \"I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a \u2018quid pro quo?\u2019 As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,\" Sondland said in his opening statement. He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on \"the president\u2019s orders,\" confirming Trump\u2019s active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.\n\n[Link to discussion thread Part IV](https://www",

It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of real estate development, urban planning, and municipal land-use strategies. New Urbanism attempts to address the ills associated with urban sprawl and post-WWII suburban development.[1][2] New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to World War II; it encompasses basic principles such as traditional neighborhood development (TND) and transit-oriented development (TOD).[3] These concrete principles emerge from two organizing concepts or goals: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.[4] New Urbanists support regional planning for open space; context-appropriate architecture and planning; adequate prov",

The history of urban planning runs parallel to the history of the city, as planning is in evidence at some of the earliest known urban sites. Prehistory [edit]The pre-Classical and Classical periods saw a number of cities laid out according to fixed plans, though many tended to develop organically. Designed cities were characteristic of the Minoan, Mesopotamian, Harrapan, and Egyptian civilisations of the third millennium BC (see Urban planning in ancient Egypt). The first recorded description of urban planning appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh: \"Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around. Inspect the foundation platform and scrutinise the brickwork.

    "gold_answer": "Intense and early heatwaves can exacerbate the severity of bushfire seasons in Australia by creating hot, dry conditions that increase the risk of fires. When heatwaves occur before the peak fire season, they can lead to an unusually active season by drying out vegetation and reducing humidity, making it easier for fires to ignite and spread.",

      "text": "An early summer heatwave swept over large parts of Australia on December 16-17, 2023, helping to fuel dozens of bushfires in New South Wales. The map above shows modeled air temperatures across Australia on December 16. It was produced by combining satellite observations with temperatures predicted by a version of the GEOS (Goddard Earth Observing System) model, which uses mathematical equations to represent physical processes in the atmosphere. The map represents temperatures at about 2 p.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time, and the darkest reds indicate areas at or above 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). The heatwave was especially intense in Western Australia, where temperatures reached above 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), which is up to 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) above normal for the time of year, according to the country\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology. On December 16, the remote mining town of Telfer recorded 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F), the highest temperature recorded anywhere in the country on that day. The heatwave also extended to the eastern parts of Australia. Temperatures in Brisbane reached 33\u00b0C (91\u00b0F) that day, and Sydney airport reached 34\u00b0C (93\u00b0F). The hot, dry conditions heightened the risk of bushfires in Western Australia, Northern Territory, and New South Wales. Near Narrabri, New South Wales (360 kilometers northwest of Sydney), a fire broke out in Pilliga Forest and quickly spread to cover 121,000 hectares (300,000 acres) by December 18. Smoke can be seen billowing from the fire in the image above, acquired by the OLI (Operational Land Imager) on Landsat 8 on December 17. Smoke drifted east from the fires and filled the skies in Sydney, causing poor air quality, according to news reports. Though Australia\u2019s fire season does not peak until January or February, the season has already been unusually active. According to Global Forest Watch, which uses data from NASA\u2019s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System), fire detections this year have already been twice as high as the "

          "text": "Lunar calendar A lunar calendar is a calendar based on the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months, lunations), in contrast to solar calendars, whose annual cycles are based on the solar year, and lunisolar calendars, whose lunar months are brought into alignment with the solar year through some process of intercalation \u2013 such as by insertion of a leap month. The most widely observed lunar calendar is the Islamic calendar.[a] The details of when months begin vary from calendar to calendar, with some using new, full, or crescent moons and others employing detailed calculations. Since each lunation is approximately 29+1\u20442 days,[1] it is common for the months of a lunar calendar to alternate between 29 and 30 days. Since the period of 12 such lunations, a lunar year, is 354 days, 8 hours, 48 minutes, 34 seconds (354.36707 days),[1] lunar calendars are 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year.

The formula was probably invented in Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium bce.

Devices and methods for keeping time have gradually improved through a series of new inventions, starting with measuring time by continuous processes, such as the flow of liquid in water clocks, to mechanical clocks, and eventually repetitive, oscillatory processes, such as the swing of pendulums. Oscillating timekeepers are used in modern timepieces. Sundials and water clocks were first used in ancient Egypt c. 1200 BC and later by the Babylonians, the Greeks and the Chinese. Incense clocks were being used in China by the 6th century. In the medieval period, Islamic water clocks were unrivalled in their sophistication until the mid-14th century.

You probably don\u2019t even think about your phone\u2019s calendar, but the history of calendars stretches back over 10,000 years. The Sumerians and Egyptians were among the first to create formal calendar systems around 2100 BC. They needed to plan harvests, religious ceremonies, and, honestly, just keep life running. Those early systems solved real, everyday problems. If you look at the journey from ancient stone circles to AI scheduling, calendar evolution mirrors bigger shifts in tech and society.

The decision followed recent developments such as the occurrence of cases in previously unaffected areas, including the first confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost 2 million people bordering Rwanda, and one case in Uganda. By 16 July 2019, a total of 2,522 confirmed and probably Ebola cases have been reported in this outbreak, 1,698 of them fatal [3]. The previous Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2014 to 2016 ended with more than 28,000 confirmed, probable and suspected cases and more than 11,000 deaths [4]. More information and the most recent rapid risk assessments by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control can be found on a website dedicated to the outbreak [5].

Their birth was the result of an \u2018experiment' (presently it can only be called that) conducted by He Jiankui with couples in which the males were HIV carriers. Using CRISPR technology to immunise the babies against the HIV virus, He Jiankui managed to disable the CCR5 gene that enables the HIV infection (although he still did not present complete evidence of this achievement). However, Chinese existing regulation, thought not very detailed, does not provide legal basis for the experiment carried out by He Jiankui and his team (Nie, 2018; Nie & Cheung, 2019). In particular, the 2003 \u201cEthical Guiding Principles for Research on Embryonic Stem Cell\u201d issued by China's Ministry of Science and Technology and then Ministry of Health (now National Health Commission), very clearly bans research to be performed on human in vitro embryos after the 14th day of existence, and its subsequent implantation into a human uterus. Furthermore, in spite of the alleged reason for the genetic intervention related with the prevention of HIV, the scientific community also knows that the CCR5 gene is related with major brain functions. He Jiankui might have done some kind of human enhancement by created two especially intelligent human beings, with better memory and higher IQ (Joy et al., 2016). This event has subsequently fuelled debate over CRISPR-Cas9, the most recent gene editing technique. Genetic engineering has been around from some time. Pretty much every argument for and against it has already been presented, and national and international regulations tried to provide a legal and ethical "

It was passed by the 117th United States Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden on August 16, 2022. It is a budget reconciliation bill sponsored by senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Joe Manchin (D-WV).[1] The bill was the result of negotiations on the proposed Build Back Better Act, which was reduced and comprehensively reworked from its initial proposal after being opposed by Manchin.[2] It was introduced as an amendment to the Build Back Better Act and the legislative text was substituted. All Democrats in the Senate and House voted for the bill while all voting Republicans voted against it.[3][4] It was described as a landmark piece of legislation.[5][6] According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the law will raise $738 billion from tax reform and prescription drug reform to lower prices, as well as authorize $891 billion in total spending \u2013 including $783 billion on energy and climate change, and three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies.[1][7] It represents the largest investment towards addressing climate change in United States history.[8] According to several independent analyses, the law is projected to reduce 2030 U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 2005 levels.[9][10] It also includes a large "

Consumer prices fell sharply after World War I and during the first several years of the Great Depression (see figure 1). Consumer prices rose at an increasingly rapid rate in the 1970s and early 1980s, with inflation exceeding 10 percent per year for a time. By contrast, since the mid-1980s, consumer price inflation generally has been low and fairly stable. U.S. households that experienced large and rapid changes in consumer prices, both increases and decreases, generally saw these movements as a major economic problem. In part, some of these price changes were symptomatic of deeper economic woes, such as soaring unemployment during the Great Depression. Moreover, large price move",

King Leopold II of Belgium promised just that and the Congo was formally recognized as Leopold\u2019s personal possession. Detailed explanation-2: -Purpose of the Berlin Conference In 1884, at the request of Portugal, German chancellor Otto von Bismark called together the major western powers of the world to negotiate questions and end confusion over the control of Africa. Detailed explanation-3: -One thing is clear-the Berlin Conference established the legal claim by Europeans that all of Africa could be occupied by whomever could take it. It also established a process for Europeans to cooperate rather than fight with each other. This cooperation played a huge role in the division and conquest of Africa. Detailed explanation-4: -The Berlin Conference of 1884\u201385 was organized by Otto von Bismarck, the rst chancellor of Germany. The purpose of the Berlin Conference was to regulate European colonization and trade in Africa by identifying which European nations would be allowed to control which parts of Africa. Detailed explanation-5: -The rivalry between European powers was also one of the main drives behind the Scramble for Africa. In order to prevent each other from acquiring more territories, the Europeans carved up the African continent into colonies."

The monastery\u2019s secular function was to provide teachers for the public schools across Moravia. It was a cultural, educational, and artistic center with an elite core of friar-teachers with a well-stocked library and other amenities including a gourmet kitchen. It was wealthy, with far-flung holdings yielding income from agricultural productions. Mendel had failed his tryout as a parish priest and did not complete his examination for teaching certification despite 2 y of study at the University of Vienna. In addition to his teaching and religious obligations, Mendel carried out daily meteorological and astronomical observations, cared for the monastery's fruit orchard and beehives, and tended plants in the greenhouse and small outdoor gardens. In the years 1856 to 1863, he carried out experiments on heredity of traits in garden peas regarded as revolutionary today but not widely recognized during his lifetime and until 16 y after his death. In 1868 he was elected abbot of the monastery, a significantly elevated position in the ecclesiastical and civil hierarchy. While he had hoped to be elected, and was honored to accept, he severely underestimated its administrative responsibilities and gradually had to abandon his scientific interests. The last decade of his life was marred by an ugly dispute with civil authorities over monastery taxation.

The Cuban Missile Crisis, October 1962 The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 was a direct and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War and was the moment when the two superpowers came closest to nuclear conflict. The crisis was unique in a number of ways, featuring calculations and miscalculations as well as direct and secret communications and miscommunications between the two sides. The dramatic crisis was also characterized by the fact that it was primarily played out at the White House and the Kremlin level with relatively little input from the respective bureaucracies typically involved in the foreign policy process. After the failed U.S. attempt to overthrow the Castro regime in Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion, and while the Kennedy administration planned Operation Mongoose, in July 1962 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev reached a secret agreement with Cuban premier Fidel Castro to place Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba to deter any future invasion attempt. Construction of several missile sites began in the late summer, but U.S. intelligence discovered evidence of a general Soviet arms build-up on Cuba, including Soviet IL\u201328 bombers, during routine surveillance flights, and on September 4, 1962, President Kennedy issued a public warning against the introduction of offensive weapons into Cuba. Despite the warning, on October 14 a U.S. U\u20132 aircraft took several pictures clearly showing sites for medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) under construction in Cuba.

The march was successful in pressuring the administration of John F. Kennedy to initiate a strong federal civil rights bill in Congress. During this event, Martin Luther King delivered his memorable \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. The 1963 March on Washington had several precedents. In the summer of 1941 A. Philip Randolph, founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, called for a march on Washington, D.C., to draw attention to the exclusion of African Americans from positions in the national defense industry. This job market had proven to be closed to blacks, despite the fact that it was growing to supply materials to the Allies in World War II. The threat of 100,000 marchers in Washington, D.C., pushed President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802, which mandated the formation of the Fair Employment Practices Commission to investigate racial discrimination charges against defense firms. In response, Randolph cancelled plans for the march. Civil rights demonstrators did assemble at the Lincoln Memorial in May 1957 for a Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom on the third anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, and in October 1958, for a Youth March for Integrated Schools to protest the lack of progress since that ruling. King addressed the 1957 demonstration, but due to ill health after being stabbed by Izola Curry, Coretta Scott King delivered his scheduled remarks at the 1958 event. By 1963, the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, most of the goals of these earlier protests still had not been realized. High levels of black unemployment, work that offered most African Americans only minimal wages and poor job mobility, systematic disenfranchisement of many African Americans, and the persistence of racial segregation in the South prompted discussions about a"

As the United States spread across the Appalachians, the Mississippi River became an increasingly important conduit for the produce of America\u2019s West (which at that time referred to the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi). Since 1762, Spain had owned the territory of Louisiana, which included 828,000 square miles. The territory made up all or part of fifteen modern U.S. states between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. The Pinckney treaty of 1795 had resolved friction between Spain and the United States over the right to navigate the Mississippi and the right for Americans to transfer their goods to ocean-going vessels at New Orleans. With the Pinckney treaty in place and the weak Spanish empire in control of Louisiana, American statesmen felt comfortable that the United States\u2019 westward expansion would not be restricted in the future. This situation was threatened by Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s plans to revive the French empire in the New World. He planned to recapture the valuable sugar colony of St. Domingue from a slave rebellion, and then use Louisiana as the granary for his empire. France acquired Louisiana from Spain in 1800 and took possession in 1802, sending a large French army to St. Domingue and preparing to send another to New Orleans. Westerners became very apprehensive about having the more-powerful French in control of New Orleans: President Thomas Jefferson noted, \u201cThere is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans.\u201d In addition to making military preparations for a conflict in the Mississippi Valley, Jefferson sent James Monroe to join Robert L"

      "text": "The pyramids of Egypt fascinated travellers and conquerors in ancient times and continue to inspire wonder in the tourists, mathematicians, and archeologists who visit, explore, measure, and describe them. Tombs of early Egyptian kings were bench-shaped mounds called mastabas. Around 2780 BCE, King Djoser's architect, Imhotep, built the first pyramid by placing six mastabas, each smaller than the one beneath, in a stack to form a pyramid rising in steps. This Step Pyramid stands on the west bank of the Nile River at Sakkara near Memphis. Like later pyramids, it contains various rooms and passages, including the burial chamber of the king. The transition from the Step Pyramid to a true, smooth-sided pyramid took placed during the reign of King Snefru, founder of the Fourth Dynasty (2680\u20132560 BCE). At Medum, a step pyramid was built, then filled in with stone, and covered with a limestone casing. Nearby at Bahshur, construction was begun on a pyramid apparently planned to have smooth sides. About halfway up, however, the angle of incline decreases from over 51 degrees to about 43 degrees, and the sides rise less steeply, causing it to be known as the Bent Pyramid. The change in angle was probably made during construction to give the building more stability. Another great pyramid was built at Dahshur with its sides rising at an angle of somewhat over 43 degrees, resulting in a true, but squat looking pyramid. The largest and most famous of all the pyramids, the Great Pyramid at Giza, was commissioned by Snefru's son, Khufu, known also as Cheops, the later Greek form of his name. The pyramid's base covered over 13 acres and its sides rose at an angle of 51 degrees 52 minutes and were over 755 feet long. It originally stood over 481 feet high; today it is 450 feet high. Scientists estimate that its stone blocks average over two tons apiece, with the largest weighing as much as fifteen tons each.

          "text": "Introduction The architectural achievements of ancient Rome are often remembered for their grandeur and innovation. However, a deep dive into Roman architecture reveals a profound Greek influence that shaped its development. This influence is evident in various elements such as the adoption of orders, the use of columns, and the integration of Greek aesthetics and techniques into Roman building practices. The Romans were not mere imitators, but rather adaptors of Greek architectural principles, which they modified to suit their needs and ambitions. By examining the Greek influence on Roman architecture, one gains insight into how cultural exchanges can lead to the evolution of architectural forms. This essay seeks to explore the extent of Greek influence on Roman architecture, focusing on key architectural elements, the philosophical and aesthetic considerations, and the socio-political implications of these adaptations. Through this exploration, the essay will argue that while Roman a",

King told the assembled crowd: \u201cThere never was a moment in American history more honorable and more inspiring than the pilgrimage of clergymen and laymen of every race and faith pouring into Selma to face danger at the side of its embattled Negroes\u201d (King, Address at the Conclusion of the Selma to Montgomery March, 121). On 2 January 1965 King and SCLC joined SNCC, the Dallas County Voters League, and other local African American activists in a voting rights campaign in Selma where, in spite of repeated registration attempts by local blacks, only two percent were on the voting rolls. SCLC had chosen to focus its efforts in Selma because they anticipated that the notorious brutality of local law enforcement under Sheriff Jim Clark would attract national attention and pressure President Lyndon B. Johnson and Congress to enact new national voting rights legislation. The campaign in Selma and nearby Marion, Alabama, progressed with mass arrests but little violence for the first month. That changed in February, however, when police attacks against nonviolent demonstrators increased. On the night of 18 February, Alabama state troopers joined local police breaking up an evening march in Marion. In the ensuing melee, a state trooper shot Jimmie Lee Jackson, a 26-year-old church deacon from Marion, as he attempted to protect his mother from the trooper\u2019s nightstick. Jackson died eight days later in a Selma hospital. In response to Jackson\u2019s death, activists in Selma and Marion set out on 7 March to march from Selma to the state capitol in Montgomery.

These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations.[3][4] At ",

The first major Roman road\u2014the famed Appian Way, or \u201cqueen of the roads\u201d\u2014was constructed in 312 B.C. to serve as a supply route between republican Rome and its allies in Capua during the Second Samnite War. From then on, road systems often sprang from Roman conquest. As the legions blazed a trail through Europe, the Romans built new highways to link captured cities with Rome and establish them as colonies. These routes ensured that the Roman military could out-pace and out-maneuver its enemies, but they also aided in the everyday maintenance of the Empire. Reduced travel time and marching fatigue allowed the fleet-footed legions to move as quickly as 20 miles a day to respond to outside threats and internal uprisings. Even the most isolated parts of the Roman world could expect to be swiftly supplied or reinforced in the event of an emergency, lessening the need for large and costl",

    "gold_answer": "Their relationship showcased a form of nationalism that was intertwined with cosmopolitanism, as both poets supported a global connectivity beyond mere national allegiance. Despite being nationalists, their perspectives were influenced by the global network of colonialization and cultural exchange, which allowed them to engage with broader ideological movements while still maintaining a nuanced stance towards imperialism. This complexity is highlighted by their shared experiences and interactions in London, as well as their reputations for being sympathetic to the British imperial cause at times, reflecting the dual tensions of colonial and cosmopolitan identities.",

A gift from the Indian Embassy to Ireland unveiled in 2015, the writer\u2019s bust stands austere in the middle of the county seat, which has a population of under 20,000 people. Why a bronze statue of India\u2019s \u201cnational poet\u201d was erected in the western countryside of Ireland can be explained via one of Ireland\u2019s most famous spokespeople: W. B. Yeats. Poets William Butler Yeats and Rabindranath Tagore are often paired for their remarkable similarities. Most notably, both won the Nobel Prize: Tagore in 1913 and Yeats a decade later in 1923. Born in 1861 and 1865, respectively, Tagore and Yeats traveled around the imperial metropole London at the same time and ran in similar circles, involved in cultural and political movements representing their home countries of Ireland and India, respectively, at the peak of the British Empire. Both poets were interested in the relationship of spirituality, music, and poetry; both poets used landscape and nature in their poetic imagery. They also shared a poor reputation among anti-colonial nationalists; both were seen as being sympathetic to the British imperial cause at certain points in their careers. Though Tagore and Yeats were nationalists, their form of nationalism drew from \u201cnew\u201d cosmopolitanism emphasizing the global nature of nationalism striving for a larger connectivity, as Louise Blakeney Williams notes. A growing network of colonialization, industry, and trade routes at the turn of the century fostered metropole-periphery relationships and provided increased opportunity for post/colonial encounters on the micro and macro level. These encounters, which critics such as Louis Althusser and Homi Bhabha most notably have discussed in their works, served as moments of identity negotiation between colonizer and colonized as well as between different colonized populations. Though the post/colonial encounter "

However, many elements of what is typically termed \"Victorian\" architecture did not become popular until later in Victoria's reign, roughly from 1850 and later. The styles often included interpretations and eclectic revivals of historic styles (see historicism). The name represents the British and French custom of naming architectural styles for a reigning monarch. Within this naming and classification scheme, it followed Georgian architecture and later Regency architecture and was succeeded by Edwardian architecture. Although Victoria did not reign over the United States, the term is often used for American styles and buildings from the same period, as well as those from the British Empire. Victorian ar",

      "text": "John Spencer and Jayson Geroux | 06.28.21 The Battle of Stalingrad (modern-day Volgograd) occurred from August 23, 1942 to February 2, 1943 during World War II (1939\u20131945). The city is in the southwestern region of what was then the Soviet Union. The majority of the city rests on the west bank of the Volga River 970 kilometers southeast of Moscow. The Volga flows southwesterly into the city, passing through it before turning directly east and then curving gently to the southeast toward the Caspian Sea. The Battle The battle was fought by the Axis powers of Army Group B\u2014principally the German 6th Army commanded by Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus within the city\u2014and the Soviet Union\u2019s Stalingrad Front and its subordinate 62nd Army (commanded by General Vasily Chuikov) and 64th Army (commanded by General Mikhail Shumilov). Known as the biggest defeat in the history of the German Army, the battle destroyed Germany\u2019s reputation of invincibility and sent the country into a more-or-less defensive mode for the duration of the war. The battle nearly guaranteed that Germany had begun the path to defeat on the Eastern Front. The German Army Group South\u2019s original strategic intent was to advance to and seize the Caucasus oil fields but German leader Adolf Hitler\u2019s additional strategic desire to capture the city named after his rival, the Soviet Union\u2019s Joseph Stalin, was too tempting to refuse. The city was also an attractive target because it produced Soviet armored fighting vehicles and other military equipment. Seizing the city would allow half of Army Group South to provide a certain level of protection to the other half by shielding the latter\u2019s northeastern flank as it advanced to the Caucasus; thus, its capture at the operational level was considered crucial by the Germans. Hitler thus split Army Group South into two smaller army groups, with Army Group A continuing south toward the Caucasus while Army Group B diverted east toward the city.

In terms of fortification, the Middle Ages saw the emergence of the castle in Europe, which then spread to the Holy Land (modern day Israel and Palestine). Organization [edit]The medieval knight was usually a mounted and armoured soldier, often connected with nobility or royalty, although (especially in north-eastern Europe) knights could also come from the lower classes, and could even be enslaved persons.

From the 12th to 15th century CE medieval warfare became very much a case of win the siege, win the war, especially when targets were administrative centres or occupied a position of particular strategic importance. Castle & City Defences Early castles in France and Britain during the 11th century CE adopted the motte and bailey castle design.

    "gold_answer": "The Western powers were committed to maintaining control over West Berlin due to its symbolic importance as a showcase of capitalist success and political freedom within a communist region. It also served as a strategic foothold deep inside East German territory, illustrating the ideological divide between East and West. Additionally, securing West Berlin was crucial to prevent the spread of communism and to uphold post-World War II agreements, making it a central issue in the broader Cold War context.",

The Berlin Crisis, 1958\u20131961 On November 10, 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev delivered a speech in which he demanded that the Western powers of the United States, Great Britain and France pull their forces out of West Berlin within six months. This ultimatum sparked a three year crisis over the future of the city of Berlin that culminated in 1961 with the building of the Berlin Wall. The division of Germany and its capital city of Berlin among the four victors of the Second World War was frozen in time by the onset of the Cold War despite the postwar agreements to unify the zones. West Berlin remained under western control, but it was located deep inside East German territory, and that made its protection from communist takeover a constant challenge for the western powers. In 1948, the Soviet Union sparked a crisis in the city by cutting off land access between West Germany and West Berlin, necessitating a year-long airlift of supplies to the stranded citizens before the Soviets reopened the passageways. By 1958, however, a similar situation would have doomed the city; it was already too populous and too prosperous to be supplied via air. The United States heralded the economic success and political freedom of West Berlin as a symbol of the success of the capitalist system, and it was deeply committed to its security, so a Soviet decision to cut off land access again had the potential to lead to a more serious conflict between the two powers. At the same time, the existence of West Berlin was increasingly becoming a liability for the Soviet Union and the East German government. The divided city highlighted the sharp contrast between the communist and capitalist systems, and the freedom of movement between the sectors had resulted in a mass exodus from the eastern side.

      "text": "1. What is the legend of the Trojan War, and how is it described in Greek mythology? Answer: The Trojan War, as described in Greek mythology, is a legendary conflict between the city of Troy and a coalition of Greek states. It began when Paris, a Trojan prince, abducted Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. This act led to a coalition of Greek forces led by Agamemnon attacking Troy. The war lasted ten years, marked by epic battles, divine interventions, and iconic characters such as Achilles, Hector, and Odysseus. The war ended with the Greeks using the Trojan Horse to infiltrate Troy, leading to its destruction. 2. Who were the primary leaders on both sides of the Trojan War? Answer: On the Greek side, Agamemnon, king of Mycenae, was the overall leader. Key figures included Achilles, the greatest warrior; Odysseus, known for his cunning; and Menelaus, whose wife\u2019s abduction triggered the war. On the Trojan side, King Priam ruled with his sons Hector and Paris playing major roles. Hector was Troy\u2019s greatest warrior, while Paris initiated the war by abducting Helen. 3. What role did the gods play in the Trojan War according to the Iliad? Answer: The gods were deeply involved in the Trojan War, often taking sides and influencing outcomes. Hera, Athena, and Poseidon supported the Greeks, while Aphrodite, Apollo, and Ares backed the Trojans. Zeus remained somewhat neutral but intervened occasionally to maintain a balance. The gods\u2019 quarrels mirrored the conflicts of mortals, and their interventions often changed the course of battles. 4. What is the significance of the Judgment of Paris in the context of the Trojan War? Answer: The Judgment of Paris is a pivotal event leading to the Trojan War. Eris, the goddess of discord, presented a golden apple \u201cfor the fairest,\u201d leading to a contest between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris, chosen as the judge, awarded the apple to Aphrodite, who promised him the love of Helen. This decision directly led to Helen\u2019s abducti"

Constitutional Convention and Ratification, 1787\u20131789 The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia met between May and September of 1787 to address the problems of the weak central government that existed under the Articles of Confederation. The United States Constitution that emerged from the convention established a federal government with more specific powers, including those related to conducting relations with foreign governments. Under the reformed federal system, many of the responsibilities for foreign affairs fell under the authority of an executive branch, although important powers, such as treaty ratification, remained the responsibility of the legislative branch. After the necessary number of state ratifications, the Constitution came into effect in 1789 and has served as the basis of the United States Government ever since. Under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government faced many challenges in conducting foreign policy, largely due to its inability to pass or enforce laws that individual states found counter to their interests. The 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the American War of Independence, stipulated that debts owed by Americans to British subjects were to be honored, and also stipulated that former British loyalists could bring forth suits in U.S. courts to recover confiscated property. These provisions were unpopular and many states blocked their enforcement. This led to British refusal to vacate military forts in U.S. territory. Additionally, after the war, British traders flooded U.S. markets with British goods, to the detriment of American importers and manufacturers. The Confederation Congress lacked the authority to regulate this trade, and intrastate trade was further hampered by states\u2019 own attempts to impose import duties on goods from elsewhere in the United States.

In order to better understand this decade-long civil war, we offer an overview of the main players on the competing sides, primary source materials for point of view analysis, discussion of how the arts reflected the era, and links to Chronicling America, a free digital database of historic newspapers, that covers this period in great detail. Background Prior to the arrival of European conquistadors, the region now known as Mexico was home to one of the world's most advanced Empires: the Aztecs. After a brutal period of colonialism and eventual conquest in 1521, the most powerful citizens were European, Spanish-born citizens or the peninsulares living in the New World. Three centuries later, in 1821, the war for Independence (starting in 1810) ended, freeing Mexico from New Spain. This was a war that, however, benefited mainly the criollo (Spanish-blooded upper class) minority. A century later, in 1910, the majority of the population of Mexico were mestizos, half-indigenous and half-Spanish-blooded Mexicans, and these indigenous peoples again rose up in a violent armed struggle, the Mexican Revolution. The motives for waging the Mexican Revolution grew out of the belief that a few wealthy landowners could no longer continue the old ways of Spanish colonial rule; a feudal-like system called la encomienda. That system needed to be replaced by a modern one in which those who actually worked the land should extract its wealth through their labor. Two great figures, Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Villa from the north of Mexico and Emiliano Zapata from the south, led the revolution and remain key "

One of the most prominent companies was the East India Company from Britain, which at one time controlled half of the world\u2019s trade. It recruited its own army and began seizing control of India region by region. Sometimes it took control through military force, such as through winning the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Other times it gained power through economic dominance. For a time, the British government allowed the East India Company a lot of leverage in taking over regions in India because England was benefiting financially. However, when decades of unrest and resistance by Indians against the East India Company eventually resulted in Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the British government dissolved the East India Company but kept control of its land. This is how Britain took over large portions of what is now modern-day India. The Sepoy Mutiny and the British Raj One of the first united actions that Indians took against British control was the Sepoy Mutiny. Indians were angered by the increasing pressure to convert to Christianity by the British, and they were also growing concerned about attempts to Westernize their country. When Hindu and Muslim soldiers were seemingly forced to use guns and ammunition with animal products, which is against both religions, a rebellion was sparked. The fighting spread through northern and central India over the course of several months, uniting groups of Indians in a common cause. There was a lot of violence and death on both sides, and the conflict stretched on for more than a year. The rebellion ended on June 19, 1858 when the British recapture"

The same cannot be said for Mao's China. Its economy did grow, but its population grew just as fast making the gains moot. It's per capita wealth miserably low, far lower than Russia's or America's and even worse than many African countries.\nSo while it may be true that China is becoming a potential superpower now, how come it took so much longer than it took for Russia?\n\nEdit, to those who misinterpret what I mean by \"superpower status\"\nI don't mean superpower in the sense of playing war games and dominating the world, I mean in terms of economic or industrial strength.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 1949 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 by the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. NATO was the first peacetime military alliance the United States entered into outside of the Western Hemisphere. After the destruction of the Second World War, the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild their economies and ensure their security. The former required a massive influx of aid to help the war-torn landscapes re-establish industries and produce food, and the latter required assurances against a resurgent Germany or incursions from the Soviet Union. The United States viewed an economically strong, rearmed, and integrated Europe as vital to the prevention of communist expansion across the continent. As a result, Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a program of large-scale economic aid to Europe. The resulting European Recovery Program, or Marshall Plan, not only facilitated European economic integration but promoted the idea of shared interests and cooperation between the United States and Europe. Soviet refusal either to participate in the Marshall Plan or to allow its satellite states in Eastern Europe to accept the economic assistance helped to reinforce the growing division between east and west in Europe. In 1947\u20131948, a series of events caused the nations of Western Europe to become concerned about their physical and political security and the United States to become more closely involved with European affairs. The ongoing civil war in Greece, along with tensions in Turkey, led President Harry S. Truman to assert that the United States would provide economic and military aid to both countries, as well as to any other nation struggling against an attempt at subjugation. "

It was not the first time police raided a gay bar, and it was not the first time LGBTQ+ people fought back, but the events that would unfold over the next six days would fundamentally change the discourse surrounding LGBTQ+ activism in the United States. While Stonewall became well known due to the media coverage and the subsequent annual Pride traditions, it was a culmination of years of LGBTQ+ activism. Historians have noted that the shift in activism, if Stonewall truly represented one at all, was a shift primarily for white cisgender people, as people of color and gender non-conforming people never truly had the benefit of concealing their marginalized identities. While the events of Stonewall are often referred to as \"riots,\" Stonewall veterans have explicitly stated that they prefer the term Stonewall uprising or rebellion.

The revolt, which lasted until 1804, came to be known as the Haitian Revolution, the first successful slave uprising that culminated in the overthrow of French and European control and then the birth of the world\u2019s first black republic. It was the first time in all of history that blacks were able to challenge the prevailing stereotypes about their race being inferior and lacking the capacity to rule themselves. The Haitian Revolution, which was anything but a simple affair, sent shockwaves throughout the world. And even to this day, the successful insurrection, which is known in French as r\u00e9volution ha\u00eftienne, continues to serve as a potent inspiration in the struggle against racism, oppression, and all forms of neo-colonialism across the world.

Famed Italian navigator and explorer Christopher Columbus is credited with being the first-known European for setting eyes on Haiti in December 1492. The explorer called the island La Isla Espa\u00f1ola (\u201cThe Spanish Island\u201d) in honor of the Spanish monarchs that backed his expedition to the New World. Ultimately, the island came to be called Hispaniola in English. In the decades that followed, not only did the natives of the island suffer and die as a result of diseases brought forth by the European settlers, the natives were enslaved and sent to work in the mines under terrible conditions. Such was the devastation unleashed (directly"

The city\u2019s development during the Uruk period exemplifies the transition from small, agrarian communities to large, complex urban societies. Early Urbanization and Population Growth During the mid-4th millennium BC, Uruk became a beacon of early urbanization in the region of Sumer. By the final phase of the Uruk period, around 3100 BC, Uruk had burgeoned into a sprawling metropolis. Archaeological estimates suggest that the city may have housed up to 40,000 residents within its boundaries, while its surrounding environs supported an additional 80,000 to 90,000 people. This population size made Uruk the largest urban area in the world at that time, showcasing its prominence and the advanced nature of its society. Architectural and Technological Innovations Uruk was a hub of architectural and technological innovation. The city is credited with the development of monumental architecture, including the famous White Temple and the massive defensive walls that encircled the city.

According to Dr. Vicki Ewens, \u201c*To have \\[over 8,000\\] bones coming from one ditch is extraordinary.*\u201d As to why they are there, no one knows. The bones have no cut or burn marks, so they probably weren\u2019t eaten (though they could have been boiled). Many ancient civilizations saw the frog as a symbol for fertility, so it\u2019s possible that it was ceremonial. Or the frogs could have simply been trapped by chance.

The continent of Africa was invaded, divided and then colonized by seven major Western powers, with France and Britain taking the lion\u2019s share of the continent. Many of the boundaries that exist today on the African continent was drawn up during this conquest, which had lasting social, political and economic effects, often times negative, for many decades. It\u2019s worth mentioning the fact that European empires at the time, who were usually at each other\u2019s throats, were able to smoothly carve up the continent without the need for a single major conflict among themselves. The sheer size of the loot (i.e. Africa\u2019s vast natural resources) was enough reason for the kings and queens in Europe to put aside their differences and impose a direct rule over the continent. In the article below WHE explores the rationale behind Europe\u2019s conquest of Africa, the effects it had on Africans in general, and how that direct rule morphed into what some scholars see as neo-colonialism today. The state of affairs before the Scramble for Africa Before imperial powers began imposing their direct rule over Africa in the late 19th century, the kind of relationship that existed between the European powers and the Africans was mainly economic. There was some bit of military ties however. For example it was not uncommon for Europeans, particularly businessmen, to establish both military and political ties with a the locals that inhabited on the coasts of Africa. Those initial ties were aimed at boosting trade between the two parties. Initially, Europeans did not see the need in moving inland to explore. They appeared quite content with the trading relationship that existed. Besides, moving further inland came with a tremendous amount of risk aside the ma"

This marriage is typically performed in order to free the raped woman from the dishonor of having lost her virginity while unmarried. The interesting thing about this phenomenon is that, within this system, the act of rape is not formally considered a criminal act in itself, nor is it seriously considered a personal violation of the woman\u2019s bodily autonomy. Rather, the rape is more so considered a violation of the social morality of the society; it is a public dishonor upon the raped woman and her family.\n\nI first learned about the basic concept of rehabilitating marriage from the Bible.

The proclamation declared \"that all persons held as slaves\" within the rebellious states \"are, and henceforward shall be free.\" Despite this expansive wording, the Emancipation Proclamation was limited in many ways. It applied only to states that had seceded from the United States, leaving slavery untouched in the loyal border states. It also expressly exempted parts of the Confederacy (the Southern secessionist states) that had already come under Northern control. Most important, the freedom it promised depended upon Union (United States) military victory. Although the Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery in the nation, it captured the hearts and imagination of millions of Americans and fundamentally transformed the character of the war. After January 1, 1863, every advance of federal troops expanded the domain of freedom. Moreover, the Proclamation announced the acceptance of black men into the Union Army and Navy, enabling the liberated to become liberators. By the end of the war, almost 200,000 black soldiers and sailors had fought for the Union and freedom. From the first days of the Civil War, slaves had acted to secure their own liberty. The Emancipation Proclamation confirmed their insistence that the war for the Union must become a war for freedom. It added moral force to the Union cause and strengthened the Union both militarily and politically. As a milestone along the road to slavery's final destruction, the Emancipation Proclamation has assumed a place among the great documents of human freedom. The original of the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, is in the National Archives in Washington, DC.

      "text": "Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) Throughout history, China was plagued by internal revolts and rebellions. Often these revolts were movements that gave people hope for a different life and offered an end to their suffering. For this reason, the Chinese authorities were always suspicious and alert for the development of any group that challenged traditional beliefs in family and state. The 1800s were no different. What was striking, however, was the kind of rebellion that occurred and the extent of the upheavals. No other event devastated China as much in the 19th century as the Taiping (pronounced tie-ping) Rebellion (1850-64). It was sparked by the leadership of one man, Hong Xiuquan (pronounced shiou-chuan), from the south of China, who in 1847 failed the imperial examinations for the third time and was delirious for 30 days. When he recovered, he believed that he and his band of believers had been chosen to conquer China, destroy the demon Manchu rulers, and establish the Taiping Tianguo \u2014 the Heavenly Kingdom of Great Harmony. Gathering followers first from the poor and outcast, he and his recruits gradually built up an army and political organization that swept across China. They made their way to central China and by the late 1850s controlled over a third of the country. Their movement was so strong and so popular that it took the central government millions of dollars and fifteen years to defeat them. Not until 1864 was the rebellion brutally put down. It is estimated that the entire rebellion cost more than twenty million lives (twice that of World War I). Even by the 1950s, some parts of central China had not yet fully recovered from the destruction of the Taiping era. Taiping Beliefs The Taipings took their beliefs from many different sources. Some of these beliefs reflected traditional Confucianism and some were from ancient writings that described ideal systems that had never been practiced. Other ideas were Western in origin.

It was so important that no senator could enter the province without the Princep's direct approval, there was even a huge scandal when the heir apparent Germanicus made a trip into Egypt when Tiberius was still emperor.

The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king Shennong, a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as \"working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached.\"[1] They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society.

The Warsaw Treaty Organization, 1955 The Warsaw Treaty Organization (also known as the Warsaw Pact) was a political and military alliance established on May 14, 1955 between the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries. The Soviet Union formed this alliance as a counterbalance to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a collective security alliance concluded between the United States, Canada and Western European nations in 1949. The Warsaw Pact supplemented existing agreements. Following World War II, the Soviet Union had concluded bilateral treaties with each of the East European states except for East Germany, which was still part of the Soviet occupied-territory of Germany. When the Federal Republic of Germany entered NATO in early May 1955, the Soviets feared the consequences of a strengthened NATO and a rearmed West Germany and hoped that the Warsaw Treaty Organization could both contain West Germany and negotiate with NATO as an equal partner. Soviet leadership also noted that civil unrest was on the rise in Eastern European countries and determined that a unified, multilateral political and military alliance would tie Eastern European capitals more closely to Moscow. The original signatories to the Warsaw Treaty Organization were the Soviet Union, Albania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. Although the members of the Warsaw Pact pledged to defend each other if one or more of them came under attack, emphasized non-interference in the internal affairs of its members, and supposedly organized itself around collective decision-making, the Soviet Union ultimately controlled most of the Pact\u2019s decisions. The Soviet Union also used the Pact to contain popular dissent in its European satellites, for example in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in "

A laywoman, consecrated to virginity yet not cloistered, Joan of Arc was involved in the most dramatic conflicts of the Church and society of the time. Condemned as a heretic through a purely political show trial, she was sentenced to a tragic death even before her trial began - burned at the stake in the old market square of Rouen. Born in 1412 into a family of wealthy peasants in Domr\u00e9my in Lorraine, at the age of 13 Joan saw an apparition of Saint Michael in the guise of a knight, of Saint Margaret of Antioch and of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Archangel and his two Saints ordered her to take the Dauphin, the future King Charles VII of Valois, to Reims to have him duly crowned and \u201cto drive the English from France\u201d. Her response to divine intervention was a vow of virginity and an intense life of prayer and frequent reception of the Sacraments. This young peasant girl felt an urgent need to console her people, to show everyone God\u2019s mercy. Her public commitment was the manifestation of her mystical experiences. The voices that Joan heard became a test for her. She spoke of them to no one, but the voices continued to be heard insistently. At the age of sixteen, she decided to confide in her uncle, Durand Laxart, who took her to Robert de Baudricourt, captain of Vaucouleurs, a fortress near Domr\u00e9my. The officer advised them to take Joan back to her parents and not to listen to her. However, the following year, the English invaded Lorraine, and with determination, Joan returned to captain Baudricourt, who then asked his parish priest to verify that she was not demonically possessed. Having received reassurance, he assigned her some men to escort her and had her accompanied to Chinon to meet the Dauphin. Thus began the public life of Joan who, a"

      "text": "Voting Rights Act (1965) This act was signed into law on August 6, 1965, by President Lyndon Johnson. It outlawed the discriminatory voting practices adopted in many southern states after the Civil War, including literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. This \u201cact to enforce the fifteenth amendment to the Constitution\u201d was signed into law 95 years after the amendment was ratified. In those years, African Americans in the South faced tremendous obstacles to voting, including poll taxes, literacy tests, and other bureaucratic restrictions to deny them the right to vote. They also risked harassment, intimidation, economic reprisals, and physical violence when they tried to register or vote. As a result, African-American voter registration was limited, along with political power. In 1964, numerous peaceful demonstrations were organized by Civil Rights leaders, and the considerable violence they were met with brought renewed attention to the issue of voting rights. The murder of voting-rights activists in Mississippi and the attack by white state troopers on peaceful marchers in Selma, Alabama, gained national attention and persuaded President Johnson and Congress to initiate meaningful and effective national voting rights legislation. The combination of public revulsion to the violence and Johnson's political skills stimulated Congress to pass the voting rights bill on August 5, 1965. The legislation, which President Johnson signed into law the next day, outlawed literacy tests and provided for the appointment of federal examiners (with the power to register qualified citizens to vote) in those jurisdictions that were \"covered\" according to a formula provided in the statute. In addition, Section 5 of the act required covered jurisdictions to obtain \"preclearance\" from either the District Court for the District of Columbia or the U.S. Attorney General for any new voting practices and procedures.

Traditionally, a voting machine has been defined by its mechanism, and whether the system tallies votes at each voting location, or centrally. Voting machines should not be confused with tabulating machines, which count votes done by paper ballot. Voting machines differ in usability, security, cost, speed, accuracy, and ability of the public to oversee elections. Machines may be more or less accessible to voters with different disabilities. Tallies are simplest in parliamentary systems where just one choice is on the ballot, and these are often tallied manually.

The Battle of Gallipoli (February 1915 \u2013 January 1916) was a pivotal World War I campaign where the Allies sought to control the Dardanelles Strait. Despite initial optimism, the Allies faced fierce Ottoman resistance, resulting in a costly stalemate. The Gallipoli Campaign holds significant national importance for Australia, New Zealand, and Turkey, shaping their modern identities. Reasons why the Allies wanted to seize the Ottoman Straits The Gallipoli Campaign was conceived as a way to open up a new front against the Central Powers, specifically the Ottoman Empire, which was an ally of Germany. Thus it was hoped that the campaign the east could relieve pressure on the heavily contested Western and Eastern fronts. The Allies (primarily Britain and France) aimed to secure the Dardanelles Strait, a strategic waterway that connects the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara, leading to Istanbul and the Black Sea. By doing so, the Allies hoped to capture Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. This would also open a maritime supply route to Russia. Moreover, a victory against the Ottomans would boost Allied morale and provide a propaganda victory, demonstrating their ability to achieve significant military objectives. It was also believed that if the Allies could quickly knock out the Ottoman Empire, it might encourage neutral nations, particularly those in the Balkans, to join the Allied cause. Whose idea was it to attack Gallipoli Peninsula? The Allies deemed the Gallipoli Peninsula extremely vital to the entire campaign. The idea to attack Gallipoli primarily originated with Winston Churchill, who was then the First Lord of the Admiralty for Britain during World War I. Churchill believed that campaign would alleviate the stalemate on the Western Front by opening a new front against the Central Powers. Despite Churchill\u2019s enthusiasm, the campaign was fraught with plan"

      "text": "THE BASIC FEATURES OF THE BRITISH INDIRECT RULE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION AND THE REASONS FOR IT'S INTRODUCTION IN WEST AFRICA Abstract Indirect Rule was a colonial administrative system in West Africa. Through this method, British authorities maintained control while preserving local political structures. Lord Lugard started this approach, which integrated traditional authorities into the colonial framework. The indigenous leaders retained their positions but remained under British rule. The British administration adopted this model for several practical reasons. Colonial personnel were limited in number. Administrative costs need to be minimized. The West African climate posed significant health risks to European officials. Language and cultural barriers made direct administration difficult. Previous success with similar systems in India also influenced this choice. The effectiveness of the Indirect Rule varied by region. Northern Nigeria proved most successful due to its existing emirate system. The Western region achieved partial success, though political tensions complicated its implementation. Eastern Nigeria presented significant challenges. The Igbo people's decentralized political structure was incompatible with the system. In the Gold Coast (modern Ghana), the system succeeded only after the restoration of legitimate Asante stool. This administrative strategy produced lasting effects on West African societies. It significantly modified traditional governance structures, causing new political divisions among ethnic groups. Traditional authorities often prioritised colonial interests above local needs, leading to social resistance and periodic civil unrest. These colonial-era changes continue to influence modern West African political structures. The impact of Indirect Rule extends into contemporary governance. Many current political challenges in West African nations trace their origins to this system. These changes affected both local authority structures a"

Burger and researchers from several U.S. institutions used accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) \u2014 an advanced form of radiocarbon dating \u2014 to date human remains recovered during the early 20th century at the monumental complex and onetime country estate of Inca Emperor Pachacuti located on the eastern face of the Andes Mountains. Their findings, published in the journal Antiquity, reveal that Machu Picchu was in use from about A.D. 1420 to A.D. 1530 \u2014 ending around the time of the Spanish conquest \u2014 making the site at least 20 years older than the accepted historical record suggests and raising questions about our understanding of Inca chronology. Historical sources dating from the Spanish invasion of the Inca Empire indicate that Pachacuti seized power in A.D. 1438 and subsequently conquered the lower Urubamba Valley where Machu Picchu is located. Based on those records, scholars have estimated that the site was built after A.D. 1440, and perhaps as late as A.D. 1450, depending on how long it took Pachacuti to subdue the region and construct the stone palace. The AMS testing indicates that the historical timeline is inaccurate. \u201cUntil now, estimates of Machu Picchu\u2019s antiquity and the length of its occupation were based on contradictory historical accounts written by Spaniards in the period following the Spanish conquest,\u201d said Burger, the Charles J.

Tutankhamen wasn't an especially important king, but his tomb was the only royal burial found intact in modern times. The tomb was important because it let archaeologists record what an Egyptian king's tomb looked like and learn more about ancient Egypt. | | Here Today, Gone Tomorrow....The Discovery of Maya's Tomb. Maya's tomb was excavated in 1843 by an archaeologist named Richard Lepsius. Like many 19th-century archaeologists, he was sent to Egypt by a European ruler -- the Prussian king, Friedrich Wilhelm IV. Lepsius was supposed to record and bring back Egyptian art, and he did remove some limestone reliefs from the tomb and send them back to the Berlin Museum. In those days it was not difficult to get permission from the Egyptian authorities to dismantle parts of tombs and temples and ship them out of the country. Today strict laws govern the export of ancient art from Egypt and other countries. We don't know exactly when the Gallery's Maya relief was taken from the tomb, but it was probably in the second half of the 19th century. Lepsius made drawings of the sculptures that decorated the tomb. These drawings record what the decoration of the tomb looked like when the Memorial Art Gallery relief was in place. Over time the tomb was covered over by sand and its location lost! | | It's Baaack.....The Re-discovery of Maya's Tomb! In 1975, more than a century after Lepsius' excavations at Saqqara, a joint expedition of archaeologists from the Egypt Exploration Society in London and the National Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, Netherlands, began to look for Maya's tomb.

It was the most sweeping civil rights legislation since Reconstruction. In a nationally televised address on June 6, 1963, President John F. Kennedy urged the nation to take action toward guaranteeing equal treatment of every American regardless of race. Soon after, Kennedy proposed that Congress consider civil rights legislation that would address voting rights, public accommodations, school desegregation, nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs, and more. Despite Kennedy\u2019s assassination in November of 1963, his proposal culminated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Lyndon Johnson signed it into law just a few hours after it was passed by Congress on July 2, 1964. The act outlawed segregation in businesses such as theaters, restaurants, and hotels. It banned discriminatory practices in employment and ended segregation in public places such as swimming pools, libraries, and public schools. Passage of the act was not easy, however. Opposition in the House of Representatives bottled up the bill in the House Rules Committee. In the Senate, Southern Democratic opponents attempted to talk the bill to death in a filibuster. In early 1964, House supporters overcame the Rules Committee obstacle by threatening to send the bill to the floor without committee approval. The Senate filibuster was overcome through the floor leadership of Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota, the considerable support of President Lyndon Johnson, and the efforts of Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen of Illinois, who convinced enough Republicans to support the bill over Democratic opposition. When the compromise bill was finally put to a vote in the Senate, it passed 73 to 27. It was noted in the Congressional Record that applause "

It was an attempt to outlaw war through diplomatic agreement, reflecting the widespread desire for peace and the reliance on treaties and international cooperation to ensure security.

The Kellogg-Briand Pact, 1928 Introduction The Kellogg-Briand Pact was an agreement to outlaw war signed on August 27, 1928. Sometimes called the Pact of Paris for the city in which it was signed, the pact was one of many international efforts to prevent another World War, but it had little effect in stopping the rising militarism of the 1930s or preventing World War II. U.S. Peace Advocates In the wake of World War I, U.S. officials and private citizens made significant efforts to guarantee that the nation would not be drawn into another war. Some focused on disarmament, such as the series of naval conferences that began in Washington in 1921, and some focused on cooperation with the League of Nations and the newly formed World Court. Others initiated a movement to try to outlaw war outright. Peace advocates Nicholas Murray Butler and James T. Shotwell were part of this movement. Both men were affiliated with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an organization dedicated to promoting internationalism that was established in 1910 by leading American industrialist Andrew Carnegie. French Involvement With the influence and assistance of Shotwell and Butler, French Minister of Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand proposed a peace pact as a bilateral agreement between the United States and France to outlaw war between them. Particularly hard hit by World War I, France faced continuing insecurity from its German neighbor and sought alliances to shore up its defenses.

Its purpose was \u201cto discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of women.\u201d Organized by women for women, many consider the Seneca Falls Convention to be the event that triggered and solidified the women\u2019s rights movement in America. Historians and other scholars agree that the leaders of the Seneca Falls Convention played a significant role in shaping the first wave of feminism in the United States and starting the fight for women\u2019s suffrage. Stanton and Mott led the convention The leaders of the Seneca Falls Convention were Elizabeth Cady Stanton and her friend Lucretia Mott. These two abolitionists met nearly ten years earlier at London\u2019s World Anti-Slavery Convention in 1840. Although they were outspoken activists against slavery and other social injustices, their voices remained unheard of in a world where men\u2019s voices dominated. Together, the duo vowed to work toward a society where women\u2019s voices would resound loudly and their rights would be equal to men\u2019s. Stanton and Mott were a likely pair from the start. Both northerners (Stanton from New York and Mott from Massachusetts), they were outspoken activists from early ages. In her 20s, Mott became a progressive Quaker minister well-known for her speeches against social injustice. At the age of 17, Stanton graduated from Emma Willard\u2019s Troy Female Seminary and began her fight for abolition, temperance, and women\u2019s rights. With Stanton\u2019s eloquent writing skills and Mott\u2019s powerful speaking abilities, the two were destined to be heard.

Their orbits are very elongated and their points farthest from the Sun are concentrated in certain directions, as if something is pulling them to one side.\n\nI made an improvised computer modeling in Space Flight Simulator, which shows that such a deviation of the orbits of TNOs can be caused by a planet on a very elongated comet-like orbit.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't see all the orbits at once in the simulator, but some stages of their evolution are screened separately and are at the end of the video.

According to two contemporary chroniclers, Ralph of Coggeshall and William of Newburgh, the kids were found near a wolf pit (hence the village name) during harvest season. What made them stand out? Their skin was green. Yeah, green. They wore odd clothes, spoke a language no one could understand, and at first refused to eat anything offered to them except raw beans.\n\nThe villagers took them in, and over time, the kids started eating normal food and lost their green tint.

Agriculture in Britain and elsewhere had made leaps forward in the 18th century, and its success released labour for factories in urban areas. From better iron tools to threshing machines, country life was transformed in the never-ceasing search for profit. Uses of Steam Power in Agriculture In the 18th century, agricultural activities across the world continued to use people power and animal muscles to make work easier and more efficient. In Europe, and particularly in Britain, the relatively high cost of labour (compared to, for example, Asia), drove inventors to create machines that would make farming cheaper and profits higher by replacing where possible traditional sources of power with machines. A change to a fundamental farming method came with Andrew Rodger's invention of the winnowing machine in Scotland in 1737. For millennia wheat had been separ",

A two-time Nobel laureate, Marie Curie is best known for her pioneering studies of radioactivity. Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867\u20131934) was the first person ever to receive two Nobel Prizes: the first in 1903 in physics, shared with Pierre Curie (her husband) and Henri Becquerel for the discovery of the phenomenon of radioactivity, and the second in 1911 in chemistry for the discovery of the radioactive elements polonium and radium. From Poland to Paris and the Radioactive The daughter of impoverished Polish schoolteachers, Marie Sklodowska worked as a governess in Poland to support her older sister in Paris, whom she eventually joined there. Already entranced with chemistry, she took advanced scientific degrees at the Sorbonne, where she met and married Pierre Curie, a physicist who had achieved fame for his work on the piezoelectric effect. For her thesis she chose to work in a field just opened up by Wilhelm Roentgen\u2019s discovery of X-rays and Becquerel\u2019s observation of the mysterious power of samples of uranium salts to expose photographic film. Curie soon convinced her husband to join in the endeavor of isolating the \u201cradioactive\u201d substance\u2014a word she coined. Polonium and Radium In 1898, after laboriously isolating various substances by successive chemical reactions and crystallizations of the products, which they then tested for their ability to ionize air, the Curies announced the discovery of polonium and then of radium salts weighing about 0.1 gram that had been derived from tons of uranium ore. After Pierre\u2019s death in 1906, when he was accidentally struck by a horse-drawn wagon, Marie achieved their objective of producing a pure specimen of radium.

Its antiquity, coupled with its notable mentions in religious texts and its strategic position, makes it a vital archaeological and historical site. Here is everything that you need to know about the ancient city of Jericho, a city generally accepted by scholars as one of the oldest in human history. Geographical Significance Located in the Jordan Valley, just north of the Dead Sea and west of the Jordan River, Jericho boasts an oasis-like environment due to a number of natural springs, particularly the Spring of Elisha. Its strategic location along ancient trade routes made it a key city in antiquity. Historical Timeline: - Pre-Pottery Neolithic (circa 10,000 \u2013 8,000 BC): The first permanent settlement at Jericho dates back to this period, marking it as one of the earliest towns. Monumental structures like the Tower of Jericho, possibly one of the earliest examples of communal architecture, were constructed during this time. - Bronze Age (circa 3,300 \u2013 1,200 BC): Jericho evolved into a fortified city with walls, marking a significant technological advance. These walls were later mentioned in the biblical story of the Battle of Jericho. - Iron Age (circa 1,200 \u2013 332 BC): Following a period of decline, Jericho regained importance under the rule of various empires, including the Egyptians, Hittites, and Assyrians. Religious Significance For many, Jericho is synonymous with the biblical story found in the Book of Joshua. According to the Hebrew Bible, the Israelites, led by Joshua, circled the walled city for seven days, and on the seventh day, with the priests sounding trumpets, the walls of Jericho fell, allowing the Israelites to capture the city.

(a) The history of the Fourteenth Amendment is inconclusive as to its intended effect on public education. (b) The question presented in these cases must be determined not on the basis of conditions existing when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but in the light of the full development of public education and its present place in American life throughout the Nation. (c) Where a State has undertaken to provide an opportunity for an education in its public schools, such an opportunity is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. (d) Segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race deprives children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities, even though the physical facilities and other \"tangible\" factors may be equal. (e) The \"separate but equal\" doctrine adopted in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, has no place in the field of public education. (f) The cases are restored to the docket for further argument on specified questions relating to the forms of the decrees. Opinion MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court. These cases come to us from the States of Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware. They are premised on different facts and different local conditions, but a common legal question justifies their consideration together in this consolidated opinion. In each "

    "gold_answer": "The sit-in movement in Greensboro in 1960 played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement by demonstrating the power of nonviolent protest in challenging racial segregation. It inspired a wave of similar sit-ins across the country, which helped to bring national attention to the issue of segregation and put pressure on businesses and lawmakers to change discriminatory policies. The success of the Greensboro sit-ins showed that direct action could lead to tangible change, contributing to the momentum that eventually led to the desegregation of public spaces and the passage of civil rights legislation.",

Although the American Civil War had ended nearly a century earlier, many African Americans lived a decidedly separate and unequal existence, especially in the southern United States. Informal and formal rules dictated where they could shop, eat, go to school, and even drink from water fountains. The consequences for failing to adhere to these rules often led to fines, imprisonment, and even violence. Even thought the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated public schools were unconstitutional in its 1954 Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, the ruling had little impact on other forms of segregation, including at privately owned lunch counters like the Greensboro F.W. Woolworth's. In 1960, Black residents accounted for more than a quarter of Greensboro's population, but formal laws and informal segregation rules forbid them from eating, drinking, or receiving services at many of the same establishments as the city's White popu"

I am convinced that Reptilian beings are REAL and that the tunnel of light that people see when they die is a trap.\n\n### Introduction \n\nFor the last 10 years, I have been researching the nature of our reality, who or what controls our society from the shadows, and more importantly what actually happens when the physical body dies and the soul leaves the body. Do we go to heaven? Do we go to hell? Do we just cease to exist? Is there a God that takes care of us? Once you begin to realize what's actually going on and how deep the rabbit hole really goes, you will never see the world in the same way so buckle up and get ready, this is not going to be easy to swallow for most people. The whole point of this post is not to frighten you, but to present you the conclusions that I've come to in regards to what actually happens when our physical bodies die after having done what feels like endless research from every angle possible.\n\nI have thor",

Around the middle of the decade, fashions arising from small pockets of young people in a few urban centers received large amounts of media publicity and began to heavily influence both the haute couture of elite designers and the mass-market manufacturers. Examples include the miniskirt, culottes, go-go boots, and more experimental fashions, less often seen on the street, such as curved PVC dresses and other PVC clothes. Mary Quant popularized the miniskirt, and Jackie Kennedy introduced the pillbox hat;[1] both became extremely popular. False eyelashes were worn by women throughout the 1960s. Hairstyles were a variety of lengths and styles.[2] Psychedelic prints, neon colors, and mismatched patterns were in style.[3] In the early to mid-1960s, London \"Modernists\" known as mods influenced ma",

The FHFA HPI\u00ae incorporates tens of millions of home sales and offers insights about house price fluctuations at the national, census division, state, metro area, county, ZIP code, and census tract levels. FHFA uses a fully transparent methodology based upon a weighted, repeat-sales statistical technique to analyze house price transaction data. What does the FHFA HPI\u00ae represent? The FHFA HPI\u00ae is a broad measure of the movement of single-family house prices. The FHFA HPI\u00ae is a weighted, repeat-sales index, meaning that it measures average price changes in repeat sales or refinancings on the same properties. This information is obtained by reviewing repeat mortgage transactions on single-family properties whose mortgages have been purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac since January 1975. The FHFA HPI\u00ae serves as a timely, accurate indicator of house price trends at various geographic levels. Because of the breadth of the sample, it provides more information than is available in other house price indexes. It also provides housing economists with an improved analytical tool that is useful for estimating changes in the rates of mortgage defaults, prepayments and housing affordability in specific geographic areas. - Other historical news releases and reports - FHFA House Price Index\u00ae FAQs - Methodology: HPI Technical Paper - FHFA House Price Index\u00ae Focus Pieces Datasets Monthly Purchase-Only Indexes The standard indexes reported in monthly news releases.

Local governments recognize the timing of its release makes it too late to use actual numbers for annual budget preparation which must be completed in December. Accordingly most local governments find it necessary to use current year forecasts which are made available quarterly through both the Governor's Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB) and the Colorado Legislative Council. Many local officials use the forecasts to calculate TABOR limitations. Doing so necessitates recalculation of limits after the release of the actual Denver-Aurora-Lakewood CPI number to compare amounts approved in the budget document and make amendments if necessary. In January 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics introduced a new geographic area for the CPI. The local CPI changed from Denver-Boulder-Greeley to Denver-Aurora-Lakewood. The B"

    "gold_answer": "Changes in student loan delinquency rates can significantly impact the broader economy. Higher delinquency rates can lead to reduced consumer spending, as individuals with delinquent loans might prioritize loan repayments over other expenditures. This can slow down economic growth. Additionally, increased delinquency rates can affect credit markets by increasing the risk perceived by lenders, potentially leading to higher interest rates or stricter borrowing conditions for consumers. On a larger scale, widespread delinquency can also impact government policy and financial stability if it leads to increased defaults and financial stress among borrowers.",

Currently this risk is rare but if these simultaneous crop failures occur, they could have significant consequences for the global food supply.[6][7] Many pests and plant diseases are expected to become more prevalent or to spread to new regions. The world's livestock are expected to be affected by many of the same issues.

Date 2019-03 ISSN Published 2019-03 Author(s) Editor(s) Abstract The degree to which domestic prices adjust to exchange rate movements is key to understanding inflation dynamics, and hence to guiding monetary policy. However, the exchange rate pass-through to inflation varies considerably across countries and over time. By estimating structural factor-augmented vector-autoregressive models for 47 countries, this paper brings to light two fundamental factors accounting for these variations: the nature of the shock triggering currency movements and country-specific characteristics. The empirical results in this paper are three-fold. First, an empirical investigation demonstrates that different domestic and global shocks can be associated with widely different pass-through ratios. Second, country characteristics matter, including policy frameworks that govern monetary policy responses, as well as other structural features th",

          "text": "Cross-Country Differences in Exchange Rate Effects on Inflation When a large fraction of a country's trade is denominated in foreign currencies, its rate of inflation is more strongly affected by exchange-rate fluctuations. Exchange rates, which give the price of a country's currency relative to foreign currencies, fluctuate based on global market dynamics. These fluctuations can affect domestic inflation rates. For example, if the U.S. dollar depreciates, imported goods generally become more expensive, and the prices of domestically produced goods may also rise as domestic producers face weaker competition from abroad. In The International Price System (NBER Working Paper 21646), Gita Gopinath argues that the relationship between exchange-rate fluctuations and inflation varies considerably from country to country. Analyzing data from 46 developed and developing nations, she finds that which currency is used to set international prices has large, asymmetric effects on whether exchange-",

A higher percentage of domestic assets may indicate a focus on the domestic market, which could lead to strategies that prioritize expanding domestic branches to strengthen local market presence and customer service.

Microeconomics analyses what is viewed as basic elements within economies, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyses economies as systems where production, distribution, consumption, savings, and investment expenditure interact; and the factors of production affecting them, such as: labour, capital, land, and enterprise, inflation, economic growth, and public policies that impact these elements. It also seeks to analyse and describe the global economy. Other broad distinctions within economics",

This process ensures the security and integrity of the currency while preventing fraud and double-spending.

Revolving credit, such as credit card debt, tends to increase when consumers are confident in their financial stability and decrease during economic uncertainty. Nonrevolving credit, which includes loans like mortgages and car loans, usually reflects long-term financial commitments. From 2020 to 2025, the initial decrease in revolving credit followed by an increase could suggest a recovery from economic uncertainty, while steady growth in nonrevolving credit might indicate sustained consumer confidence in making long-term financial commitments.

Recently I read an article in the WSJ talking about how US credit card debt has passed 1 trillion dollars and saw a post by u/squeezedeeznutz69, decided to do some analysis, and need second opinions. IMO this is huge and spells huge consequences for a couple reasons.\n\n1: It's never been this high ever, barring a financial crisis. Adjusting for inflation in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the highest amount of credit card debt held by the US population was **937m** in 2009 (Adjusted to 1.3t in 2023 value), shortly after the kickoff of the financial crisis. (Currently the credit card debt rests at **1.03t**)\n\n2: Credit cards and the credit system underpin our entire financial system. Want a car, a house, a boat, any large purchase? It relies on your credit card. **A record 40% of Americans now use credit cards as their first method of payment over debit cards and cash.**\n\n# So ho",

Additionally, if wages do not keep pace with inflation, consumers may feel a decrease in purchasing power, potentially reducing discretionary spending. Economically, higher inflation expectations can influence interest rates, as central banks might raise rates to control inflation, impacting borrowing costs and economic growth.",

This deterioration largely stems from rising worries about inflation. Buying conditions for durables plunged 14%, its lowest reading in a year, on the basis of high prices. Current personal finances declined modestly amid growing concerns about purchasing power. In contrast, expected personal finances inched up a touch along with a slight firming in income expectations, which remain subdued. Overall, consumers are no longer bracing for the worst-case scenario for the economy feared in April when reciprocal tariffs were announced and then paused. However, consumers continue to expect both inflation and unemployment to deteriorate in the future. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 4.5% last month to 4.9% this month. This increase was seen across multiple demographic groups and all three political affiliations. Long-run inflation expectations also lifted from 3.4% in July to 3.9% in August. This month ended two consecutive months of receding inflation for short-run expectations and three straight months for long-run expectations. Still, both readings remain well below the highs seen briefly in April and May 2025. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 4.5% last month to 4.9% this month. This increase was seen across multiple demographic groups and all three political affiliations. Long-run inflation expectations also lifted from 3.4% in July to 3.9% "

In the second quarter 2025, the CPS/HVS revised the entire series of housing inventory estimates back to the second quarter 2020, based on the latest series of independent housing controls, the Vintage 2024 time series. Housing inventory estimates from the first quarter 2010 through the first quarter 2020 are revised based on the Vintage 2020 time series. Housing inventory estimates from the second quarter 2000 through the fourth quarter 2009 are revised based on the Vintage 2010 time series. Housing inventory estimates, prior to the second quarter 2000, have not been revised. The revised CPS/HVS housing inventory data series are based on the independently produced Vintage 2024 housing unit estimates that are projected forward through the first quarter 2025. The same general procedure will be followed each year in revising housing inventory estimates with the most up-to-date independent housing estimates available. For an explanation of the methodology used in producing the housing inventory independent estimates, please see: http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html. Note: This time series is by the latest \"vintage\" year. For example, Vintage 2024 means that all of the estimates in this time series are identified as belonging to \"Vintage 2024.\" The 2021 data are from the 2024 vintage, the 2022 data are from the 2024 vintage, and so on."

A decrease in imports can lead to a higher GDP, as less is subtracted from the total value of domestic production. This can positively impact the perceived economic health of a country, as a higher GDP suggests a stronger economy.

The housing goals, generally set in regulation by FHFA every three years, introduce 2025\u20132027 annual benchmarks for the Enterprises\u2019 acquisitions to support equitable housing access for low-income families and families in low-income areas. \u201cThe affordable housing goals better enable the Enterprises to effectively advance their missions and support housing finance markets in a safe and sound manner,\u201d said FHFA Director Sandra L. Thompson. \u201cIt is critical that the Enterprises meet these goals, as required by law and regulation.\u201d For single-family housing goals, the Enterprises must meet the benchmark level or the actual market level of loans for each category outlined in the table below.

    "question": "How does the length of credit history influence credit scores, and why might this impact differ across age groups?",
    "gold_answer": "The length of credit history positively influences credit scores because a longer credit history provides more data for lenders to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness, making it an important component of credit scoring models, such as FICO and VantageScore. This impact differs across age groups because older individuals typically have longer credit histories, which can boost their scores. In contrast, younger individuals often have shorter credit histories, which can result in lower credit scores despite their financial behavior.",

      "text": "The average credit score in the U.S. is 702 based on the VantageScore model and 715 based on the FICO score model. That means the average American has a good credit score. Below, you can learn more about the average credit scores by year, state, age and more. Reviewing these credit score statistics will give you a better sense of how good your credit score is relative to those of your peers. Credit-score averages can also tell us a lot about the health of consumers\u2019 finances and the strength of the economy. Average Credit Score Key Stats - Average Credit Score (2024): 715 FICO Score & 702 Vantage Score - Age Group with Highest Average Credit Score (Q3 2024): 78+ year old (760) - State with Highest Average Credit Score (Q1 2025): Minnesota (725) - Region with Highest Average Credit Score (Q1 2025): Northeast (712) - City with Average Credit Score (Q1 2025): Seattle (732) Average Credit Score by Age Statistics show that credit scores tend to improve as people age. As you can see below, the oldest people have the highest credit scores, on average. And scores decline by age group all the way to the youngest cohort, which has the lowest average credit score. The accumulation of wealth and experience over time is the most likely explanation for this. As people age, they also tend to grow more financially responsible and secure, qualities that lend themselves to credit improvement. And the more time you have, the more opportunity there is to recover from mistakes. Another reason is the way credit scores are calculated. The length of your credit history accounts for a significant portion of your score (around 15%), for one thing. Some people assume that young adults have lower credit scores because they are not old enough to be approved for a credit card account. But you can still get a credit card when you turn 18 years old. You just need to demonstrate that you have access to enough independent income or assets to afford the minimum monthly payments, which are usually aro"

Because of their high frequency, these data improve identification and allow for a precise characterization of the transmission lags. We find that shocks to short-term interest rates affect spending much more rapidly than shocks to longer-term interest rates. We also detect significant asymmetries. While interest rate rises are contractionary, interest rate cuts are unable to lift spending. Finally, by exploiting the disaggregation of credit card data, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in the effects of monetary policy across spending categories and a stronger impact on higher-income users. 1 Introduction This paper provides the first assessment of the transmission of monetary policy to consumer spending using confidential credit card data. These data offer two key advantages relative to traditional consumption indicators used in the monetary policy literature. First, credit card data are",

Based on the U.S. National Financial Capability Study dataset from 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018, this study explores the nexus between consumer financial knowledge and financial behaviors of credit card use. The results indicate that financial knowledge positively affects consumer credit card ownership and desirable financial behaviors of credit card use, and is negatively related to undesirable credit card behaviors. The results are robust to different regression methods and after removing income outliers. The heterogeneity test shows that financial knowledge cannot enhance desirable credit card behaviors because of the income limitations in the low-income group.

      "text": "FDI in Africa goes green as investment outlook turns dim Renewable energy potential remains a bright spot even as foreign investments shrinks By Ronak Gopaldas The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\u2019s (UNCTAD) 2023 World Investment report (WIR) shows that foreign direct investment (FDI) into Africa fell 44% to US$45bn in 2022 from the record US$80bn in 2021. At face value, it is a very concerning trend reversal. The reality, however, is more nuanced and there are important reasons not to be too pessimistic about the headline figure. Stripping out a one-off event that inflated the FDI growth figure for Africa in 2021, African FDI still grew at 7% year-on-year, certainly more modest but still ahead of continental growth. The medium-term economic outlook, however, is deteriorating and African countries are going to have to look at new areas of competitive advantage if they want to grow or even maintain their share of global foreign direct investment flows. An uncertain economic outlook Africa accounts for just 3.5% of global FDI.[1] African countries face multiple headwinds and some are likely to negatively impact FDI over the short to medium term. The era of ultra-accommodative monetary policy is over. Despite rate hikes inflation remains stubbornly high in both developed (DM) and emerging (EM) markets. While higher inflation was stoked by record low rates and Covid-19 induced supply disruptions, its trajectory has been aggravated by the war between Russia and the Ukraine, both major global grain producers and exporters. Russia is also a major oil and gas producer and sanctions have seen a spike in energy prices. Add elevated corporate, household, and sovereign debt (US$15trn) accumulated during the low interest rate cycle and global growth prospects look dim over the short to medium-term. Geopolitical tensions have added to investor concerns. Mixed messages from the US on its Taiwan stance have annoyed China while the Chinese continue to provoke the T"

The securities regulatory regime\u2019s approach to each of these uses is fundamentally flawed. I show that the index is neither neutral nor constant: it represents substantial amounts of discretionary decision-making and is simply one particular large-cap portfolio. I then argue that an \u201cS&P 500 fund\u201d is not meaningfully passive, the mutual fund prospectus benchmark requirement is flawed, and the requirement that index constituents compare their performance to that of the index is nonsensical. I propose regulatory changes to correct these misuses. I. Introduction The S&P 500 Index1 is among the most widely recognized and widely used stock market indices. Many of these uses are intertwined with the securities regulatory regime. Trillions of dollars are invested so as to track the Index, much of it invested by highly regulated mutual funds and ETFs.2 Mutual funds are required to report their past performance relative to a benchmark index, and the overwhelming favorite is the S&P 500. Firms commonly describe their financial performance in terms of how they did relative to the Index, and the SEC requires S&P 500 constituent firms to disclose their performance relative to the Index in their 10-Ks. The S&P 500 is generally viewed as being a passive representation of \u201cthe market.\u201d In fact, it simply mimics the performance of one particular portfolio of large cap domestic equities. There is nothing particularly neutral or universal about the portfolio that the Index represents: it is the result of discretionary decision-making on the part of its creators, and its constituents change over time. Having seen this, it becomes apparent that the way that the securities regulatory regime engages with the use of the Index in each of \u201cpassive\u201d investing, mutual fund performance benchmarking, and firm perform"

      "text": "EIA has discontinued the emergency collection of data for Form EIA-862, Cryptocurrency Mining Operations Survey. Electricity demand associated with U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations in the United States has grown very rapidly over the last several years. Our preliminary estimates suggest that annual electricity use from cryptocurrency mining probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption. 1 This additional electricity use has drawn the attention of policymakers and grid planners concerned about its effects on cost, reliability, and emissions. Key challenges associated with tracking cryptocurrency mining energy use include the difficulty of identifying cryptocurrency mining activity among millions of U.S. end-use customers and the dynamic nature of the crypto market, where mining assets can be moved rapidly to areas with lower electricity prices. We have developed general estimates of electricity use by U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations by employing both top-down and bottom-up approaches. Our top-down approach involves data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which maintains an index that estimates global and national electricity use from cryptocurrency activities. We also developed our own bottom-up approach, which involves collecting data pertaining to the location of individual cryptocurrency mining operations and the amount of electricity each facility says it may use. In order to develop more rigorous estimates of electricity use by U.S. cryptocurrency miners, we have requested and received an emergency clearance pursuant to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) procedures established at 5 CFR Part 1320, Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public.2 We plan to begin collecting data on a monthly basis from February through July 2024. Although cryptocurrency mining began in the United States about a decade ago, the activity began to expand rapidly in 2019. Recent growth is largely due to cryptocurrency mining operation"

      "text": "Since March 2020, the state of the COVID-19 pandemic has determined the course of the economy nationally and across California. With each successive wave, the economy has grown more resilient to the effects of the virus, but by the end of 2020, it became clear that consumer behavior, not government restrictions, had the greatest effect on economic outcomes. That\u2019s evidenced by the facts that consumers cut back on in-person commerce and services even before governments imposed restrictions, and that service consumption fell about equally in areas that imposed restrictions and those that did not. The recent arrival of the omicron variant of the coronavirus is not great news for the U.S. economy, not least because 70% of the economy relies on consumption, according to the latest report from the UCLA Anderson Forecast. The December forecast assumes the likelihood of a winter surge in COVID-19 cases and predicts that consumers will temporarily cut back their spending on in-person services. But Anderson Forecast economists expect the impact on the economy to be relatively short term, writing that consumer spending may dip over the next quarter and then rebound quickly. The national forecast For the current quarter, UCLA Anderson Forecast senior economist Leo Feler, author of the national report, forecasts growth of 6.9%, which would be the highest growth rate for 2021, as the economy rebounds from the wave of cases caused by the delta variant. Feler notes that the omicron variant emerged too late to have much effect on the quarter\u2019s average growth rate. For the first quarter of 2022, the UCLA Anderson Forecast has now adjusted its forecast to 2.6% growth from the 4.2% predicted in September, based on the assumption that omicron might be disruptive, while acknowledging that its effects cannot be predicted. But the forecast for the second quarter of 2022 calls for stronger growth than previously predicted, as the economists expect in-person service consumption to rebound. F"

Start Your Donor Evaluation Get started as a living kidney or liver donor by completing this health history questionnaire. A liver transplant is a surgery that removes a liver that no longer functions properly (liver failure) and replaces it with a healthy liver from a deceased donor or a portion of a healthy liver from a living donor. Your liver is your largest internal organ and performs several critical functions, including: - Processing nutrients, medications and hormones - Producing bile, which helps the body absorb fats, cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins - Making proteins that help the blood clot - Removing bacteria and toxins from the blood - Preventing infection and regulating immune responses Liver transplant is usually reserved as a treatment option for people who have significant complications due to end-stage chronic liver disease. Liver transplant may also be a treatment option in rare cases of sudden failure of a previously healthy liver. The number of people waiting for a liver transplant greatly exceeds the number of available deceased-donor livers. Receiving a portion of a liver from a living donor is an alternative to waiting for a deceased-donor liver to become available. Living-donor liver transplant is possible because the human liver regenerates and returns to its normal size shortly after surgical removal of part of the organ. In 2018, about 8,200 liver transplants were performed in the U.S. among adults and children. Of those, about 390 involved livers from living donors. At the same time, about 12,800 people were registered on the waiting list for a liver transplant.

    "question": "How might rising market interest rates impact the net interest margin and overall financial performance of banks?",
    "gold_answer": "Rising market interest rates can impact the net interest margin by potentially increasing the cost of funds for banks, which could narrow the margin if banks cannot pass these costs onto borrowers. This can affect overall financial performance by reducing profitability if interest expenses rise faster than interest income, unless offset by other factors such as strong growth in noninterest income.",

Co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, the quadrennial tournament kicks off on July 20 and features an expanded field of 32 teams, up from 24. There are 64 matches during the tournament. That means more competition for the two-time defending World Cup champion U.S., which won the 2015 event in Canada and the 2019 tournament in France. The Americans have won four titles overall, most of any nation. Schedule, location The 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four teams each. Each team plays a three-game, round-robin group stage, running from July 20 to August 3. The top finishers advance to the round of 16 from August 5 to 8. The quarterfinals are set for August 11 to 12, and the two semifinal matches will be played August 15-16. A third-place game is set for August 19 in Brisbane, ahead of the final in Sydney. The final will air at 6 a.m. ET on August 20 in the United States. The broadcast schedule is complicated by the time difference. The United States is playing in Group E with Vietnam, the Netherlands and Portugal. The opening match is against Vietnam on July 22 in Auckland, which because of the time difference, will air in the U.S. on July 21 at 9 p.m. ET. A rematch of the 2019 final against the Netherlands is set for July 27 in Wellington, airing at 9 p.m. ET on July 26 in the U.S. The last group game against Portugal is set for August 1, airing at 3 a.m. ET that day.

    "question": "Why might delaying the return to unrestricted sports activity for two years after ACL reconstruction reduce the risk of a second ACL injury for younger athletes?",
    "gold_answer": "Delaying the return to unrestricted sports activity for two years might reduce the risk of a second ACL injury because it allows more time for athletes to achieve baseline joint health and function, which is typically not fully restored within the commonly expected timeline of 6 to 12 months. The risk of a second injury is highest in the first year after ACL reconstruction and decreases in the second year, indicating that waiting longer may provide better recovery and reduce the likelihood of reinjury.",

      "text": "Abstract Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common knee injuries sustained by athletes during sports participation. A devastating complication of returning to sport following ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a second ACL injury. Strong evidence now indicates that younger, more active athletes are at particularly high risk for a second ACL injury and this risk is greatest within the first two years following ACLR. Nearly one-third of the younger cohort that resumes sports participation will sustain a second ACL injury within the first two years after ACLR. The evidence indicates that the risk of second injury may abate over this time period. The incidence rate of second injuries in the first year after ACLR is significantly greater than the rate in the second year. The lower relative risk in the second year may be related to athletes achieving baseline joint health and function well after the current expected timeline (6 to 12 months) to be released to unrestricted activity. This highlights a considerable debate in the return to sport decision process as to whether an athlete should wait until two years after ACLR to return to unrestricted, sports activity. In this review, we present evidence in the literature that athletes achieve baseline joint health and function approximately two years after ACLR. We postulate that delay in returning to sports for nearly two years will significantly reduce the incidence of second ACL injuries. 1. Introduction Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are common musculoskeletal injuries sustained by athletes who participate in landing and pivoting sports. ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is the current clinical standard to provide mechanical stability to the joint and return to sports (RTS) in a timely manner.[1] One of the most devastating, and all too common, complications following a return to activity is a second ACL injury. A systematic review of prospective studies with a minimum follow-up time of 5 years found that the pooled per"

      "text": "Lance Armstrong was once an icon. In 1993, he became the professional world champion of the Union Cycliste Internationale Road World Championship. In 1996, at the age of 25, he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer. He was free of cancer by 1997 and, in that same year, founded the nonprofit organization the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation) to support cancer patients and others affected by cancer. This organization went on to raise nearly $400 million through the sale of yellow Livestrong bracelets and other fundraising efforts. Between 1999 and 2005, Armstrong achieved an unprecedented seven consecutive wins of the Tour de France. But shadowing this success were allegations that he had used banned performance-enhancing drugs. After an investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in 2012, evidence of Armstrong\u2019s doping activities was verified. He was banned from Olympic sports for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. In a 2013 televised interview with Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong admitted, for the first time, to using banned performance-enhancing drugs for years. Armstrong noted that he did so to remain competitive because other cyclists were also doping. \u201cThe definition of \u2018cheat\u2019 is to gain an advantage on a rival or foe that they don\u2019t have,\u201d Armstrong told Winfrey, \u201cI didn\u2019t view it that way. I viewed it as a level playing field.\u201d He was not alone. Doping had become common in many sports during the 1990s. During the seven years that Armstrong won the Tour de France, 20 out of the 21 top three finishers were also found to have doped at some point in their careers. Armstrong also encouraged his teammates on the U.S. cycling team to use performance-enhancing drugs and match his performance. The investigation into Armstrong\u2019s doping revealed how extensive his use of drugs was, how he developed a system to maintain secrecy, and how his teammates were pressured into doping, as well.

      "text": "Ask almost any American on the street who was the first African American to play in modern Major League baseball, and many will say Jackie Robinson. Robinson broke the color barrier when he took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers on Opening Day, April 15, 1947. Robinson almost immediately became the league's best player by virtue of his completeness. While some players were brilliant hitters or had blazing speed on the bases or were remarkable fielders, Robinson had it all. Baseball fans, in particular, are quite familiar with Robinson's story. They may have seen the famous film clip of Robinson stealing home plate against the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series. Robinson was a brilliant player by every measure. His historic accomplishment breaking modern baseball's color barrier was made possible as a result of those who came before him. When baseball teams initially organized in the decades following the Civil War, there were some integrated teams. Slowly, however, segregation began to take hold in baseball and mirror mainstream culture. As a result, black players and businessmen began looking in earnest for ways to organize leagues featuring African American players. In 1897, following a number of failed attempts, a group of Galveston, Texas businessmen set out to create what would be called the Lone Star Colored Baseball League of Texas. The league organizers identified a man whose business acumen and abilities as a player were already well known to both whites and blacks. That man was John W. \u201cBud\u201d Fowler. Fowler, well known to baseball aficionados and sports historians, is often overlooked in the larger history of the game. Fowler is considered by some as the first African American to break baseball's color barrier in 1878 for New Castle, Pennsylvania. Three years later, however, Moses Fleetwood Walker joined the Toledo Blue Stockings of the American Association. The American Association at the time was considered to be a \u201cmajor\u201d league, and as such, Wal"

They are often fighting for a mid-table place in the Premier League, just as often slugging it out in lower leagues.\n\nThe way the league works is simple: 20 teams play against each other, at home and away, adding up to 38 matches in total. You get 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss, and the team with the most points at the end of the season wins. Unlike in American sports, there are no playoffs in the Premier League. This means that a team can't make it to the playoffs, then catch fire and take the trophy home. No one wins the Premier League by luck or by going on a hot streak at just the right time. They win by being consistently the best over the course of a year. It's not at all unusual for an underdog team to get off to a great star",

    "gold_answer": "The somatic build, which refers to the body type and composition of an athlete, can significantly influence their performance in the 400-meter hurdles. In this event, a balance of speed, agility, and strength is crucial, as athletes must maintain a high speed while clearing hurdles and managing fatigue over the distance. Female athletes with a somatic build that supports strong leg muscles for power, a moderate height for efficient hurdling technique, and a lean body composition for endurance may have advantages in this event compared to others that prioritize different physical attributes.",

Type I, or slow-twitch fibers, are seen in high abundance in elite endurance athletes, such as long-distance runners and cyclists. Alternatively, fast-twitch IIa and IIx fibers are abundant in elite power athletes, such as weightlifters and sprinters. While cross-sectional comparisons have shown marked differences between athletes, longitudinal data have not clearly converged on patterns in fiber type shifts over time, particularly between slow and fast fibers. However, not all fiber type identification techniques are created equal and, thus, may limit interpretation. Hybrid fibers, which express more than one MHC type (I/IIa, IIa/IIx, I/IIa/IIx), may make up a significant proportion of fibers. The measurement of the distribution of fibers would necessitate the ability to identify hybrid fibers, which is best done through single fiber analysis. Cu",

Interest in treatment for mild TBI is at an all time high due to its association with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases, yet therapeutic options remain limited. Traditional pharmaceutical interventions have failed to transition to the clinic for the treatment of mild TBI. As such, many pre-clinical studies are now implementing non-pharmaceutical therapies for TBI. These studies have demonstrated promise, particularly those that modulate secondary injury cascades activated after injury. Because no TBI therapy has been discovered for mild injury, researchers now look to pharmaceutical supplementation in an attempt to foster success in human clinical trials.

    "gold_answer": "Economic interests, such as the rental revenue that major league team owners received from Negro League teams and the potential for larger audiences, combined with racial attitudes, including both resistance to and support for integration, played significant roles in the decision to integrate major league baseball. Some owners feared financial losses due to the collapse of the Negro Leagues and reluctance from white audiences, while others saw integration as an opportunity to attract a broader fan base.",

      "text": "Breaking the Color Line: 1940 to 1946 By the 1940s, organized baseball had been racially segregated for many years. The black press and some of their white colleagues had long campaigned for the integration of baseball. Wendell Smith of The Pittsburgh Courier was especially vocal. World War II experiences prompted more people to question segregation practices. Although several people in major league baseball tried to end segregation in the sport, no one succeeded until Brooklyn Dodger's general manager Branch Rickey set his \"great experiment\" (See Jules Tygiel's Baseball's Great Experiment in the bibliography) into motion. In 1945, the Jim Crow policies of baseball changed forever when Branch Rickey and Jackie Robinson of the Negro League's Kansas City Monarchs agreed to a contract that would bring Robinson into the major leagues in 1947. In addition to racial intolerance, economic and other complex factors contributed to segregation in baseball. For example, many owners of major league teams rented their stadiums to Negro League teams when their own teams were on the road. Team owners knew that if baseball were integrated, the Negro Leagues would probably not survive losing their best players to the majors, major league owners would lose significant rental revenue, and many Negro League players would lose their livelihoods. Some owners also thought that a white audience would be reluctant to attend games with black players. Others saw the addition of black players as a way to attract larger white as well as black audiences and sell more tickets. Looking back on this time, Rickey described the problems he faced and the events that influenced his decision in a speech to the One Hundred Percent Wrong Club in 1956. Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was involved with baseball in a variety of capacities -- as a player, coach, manager, and owner -- for more than sixty years. His Hall of Fame plaque mentions both his creation of baseball's farm system in the 1920s and his signing "

If I neglect to mention a sport's team based out of Georgia that you are passionate about, I am in no way trying to claim that your sport doesn't matter, I'm basing the research conducted below on the four major professional sports, and the three major college sports.\n\n**HISTORY**\n\nIt was a humid, hot morning in Tokyo, Japan on September 18, 1990. The 96th session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was placing their final votes in the fifth round of voting for which city would host the Summer Olympics six years later. The results came out, and it was declared that Atlanta, the bustling capital of the southeastern United States, would become the fifth American city to host the games. The runner ups were angry, and vowed to call upon the forces from below to bring misery to the simple folk of the state that stole their Olympic big. What city was the runner up you ask?\n\n^^",

      "text": "The Olympic Games: From Ancient Greece to Modern times The Olympic Games, the world\u2019s greatest sporting festival, involves a series of sporting events that draws large participation rates from over 200 countries across the world. Every four years, the game sees thousands of athletes compete in several sporting disciplines that push them to their physical and mental limits. Equally as astonishing as the current state of the Olympics, is the history behind it. The first ever Olympic event occurred about 3,000 years ago in ancient Greece. After a glorious and scintillating 12 centuries of competition, the Games got halted and outlawed by the Roman Empire. Then, in the 19th century CE, the Games made a massive and spectacular comeback onto the world stage. Ever since then, its two major components \u2013 the Summer and Winter Olympics \u2013 have mesmerized and entertained billions of people across the globe. Wordhistoryedu.com explores how this ancient game became the biggest international sporting ceremony of our modern era. Why and how did the Olympics even start in the first place? And what sorts of sport events took place back then? These and many more other questions are succinctly answered below: Why did the Olympic Games start? The Olympic Games began in the 8th century BC (probably 776 BC) at a place called Olympia, south west Greece. It was a huge festival in the lives of the Greeks because it served two main purposes. The first purpose of the Olympics back then was to honor the Greek god, Zeus. Zeus was highly revered and regarded as the king of all Greek gods. As a result of this, grand monuments, temples and festivals were made in his honor. And there was no better way to honor him than to use the biggest sporting festival that had large following and appeal. The second reason for the games\u2019 appeal had to do with the Greek\u2019s obsession and absolute love for physical fitness. Some historians note that the events were to showcase how far an individual could push himself"

Held in Athens, Greece, from April 6 to April 15, 1896, the Games were envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin, a French aristocrat who sought to revive the spirit of the ancient Olympic Games. The event symbolized a connection between Greece\u2019s historical legacy and the global aspirations of modern sports. READ MORE: Modern Olympics: Timeline Revival of the Ancient Olympics The ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia from 776 BCE to 393 CE, were a central part of Greek culture, celebrating athletic prowess and unity. However, they were discontinued during the Roman Empire. Centuries later, the Renaissance sparked interest in ancient Greek traditions, which eventually influenced Pierre de Coubertin\u2019s vision of reviving the Olympics as an international sporting competition. He believed the Games could promote peace and cultural exchange. The Birth of the IOC In 1894, Coubertin convened a congress in Paris with delegates from various countries to establish the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This meeting set the groundwork for the modern Olympics and decided that the first Games would be held in Athens to honor its historical significance. The IOC was tasked with organizing and overseeing the Olympics, making the 1896 event the first of its kind. Selecting Athens as the Host City Athens was chosen unanimously as the host city during the 1894 Paris Congress. Greece\u2019s ancient heritage and its symbolic connection to the Olympics made it an ideal location. Despite initial concerns about the financial and logistical challenges of hosting such an event, Greece embraced the opportunity. Crown Prince Constantine and other national leaders rallied public and private support, ensuring the Games could take place. Preparations and Venues The centerpiece of the Games was t"

What do you think about when you hear this word? Since you read this post on r/soccer, you probably think about rivalries in football. Most of them consist of two teams that are on at least somewhat similar level and definitely have mutual feelings for each other. But some rivalries are one-sided. And if you go even deeper, you find rivalries so one-sided that only one side is even aware of its existence. Football twitter would summarize it in two simple words: *rent free*. You may know this phrase as overused, unfunny banter, but in this case there is some truth in it.

Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies. A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as a guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group. Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.[2] Thus in military culture, valor is counted as a typical behavior for an individual, and duty, honor, and l",

Some cultures consider their own way of life to be innate, and many people believe that culture is inherent in human nature.

It also looks at the meanings that people attach to objects and activities. Those meanings are often based on tradition, and they may be independent of any specific reason.

Therefore, it is important that strength and conditioning coaches understand an athlete\u2019s hydration needs to prevent illness and enhance performance. The purpose of this study was to identify hydration knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of collegiate track and field throwers, as well as identify barriers to hydration and sources of nutritional information. The Rehydration and Refueling in Collegiate Track and Field Throwers Survey was sent to 271 track and field thrower coaches with a request to forward the email to current track and field throwers. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated regarding knowledge, attitude, and behavior scores among the participants in this sample. Differences among response patterns were assessed via Chi-square analysis. Alpha level was set at p = .05. Results demonstrated that 97.3% (n = 287) of respondents knew that dehydration would decrease performance, but 50.5% (n = 149) erroneously believed thirst was the best indicator of dehydration. Chi-square analysis demonstrated a significant difference in reported values between participants who intended to eat a performance-enhancing diet and those who consumed less fluid than recomended values (207 \u2013 295 m)l in the 2-3 hours prior to competition (\u03c72 = 10.87, p < .05). Pearson correlation coefficients demonstrated a large association between knowledge and behavior (r = .70, p < .05), a medium association between knowledge and attitude (r = .41, p < .05), and a small association between attitude and behavior (r = .21, p < .05). This suggests that strength and conditioning coaches and health staff need to educate and monitor hydration behaviors among collegiate track and field throwers to optimize performance.

Compact soil is created by the physical degradation of the soil structure by external factors. The negative results of soil compaction have a wide effect across the agricultural sector with serious economic and environmental consequences.

Root growth inhibition by soil compaction was originally thought to reflect the impact of mechanical impedance and reduced water availability. However, using a novel gas diffusion-based mechanism employing the hormone ethylene, recent research has revealed that plant roots sense soil compaction. Non-compacted soil features highly interconnected pore spaces that facilitate diffusion of gases such as ethylene which are released by root tips. In contrast, soil compaction stress disrupts the pore network, causing ethylene to accumulate around root tips and trigger growth arrest. Genetically disrupting ethylene signalling causes roots to become much less sensitive to compaction stress. Such new understanding about the molecular sensing mechanism and emerging root anatomical traits provides novel opportunities to develop crops resistant to soil compaction by targe",

    "gold_answer": "The introduction of the Designated Hitter rule allowed teams to focus more on offensive power by having a specialized hitter bat in place of the pitcher, who is typically weaker in batting. This strategic shift enabled teams to generate more runs, as designated hitters generally have higher batting averages and home run counts compared to pitchers. Consequently, it allowed pitchers to concentrate on their pitching duties without the added responsibility of batting, potentially improving their overall performance on the mound.",

      "text": "By Ava Politis '26 Introduction Professional baseball's National League was the only league to exist until the American League was founded in 1901 (\"American League is Founded\"). While both teams were considered major leagues, the American League utilized the Designated Hitter rule introduced in 1973 (\"What are the Differences Between the American and National Leagues?\"). The designated hitter is a player who does not play defense and bats in place of the pitcher since pitchers are not known as the strongest hitters on the team (\"Designated Hitter Rule | Glossary\"). For example, from 1929-1941, pitcher Wes Ferrell only hit 38 home runs in his entire professional career, which is the most a pitcher has ever hit. On the other hand, David Ortiz hit 541 home runs as a designated hitter from 1997 to 2016 as he crushed 30-plus homers in 10 different seasons (\"All time home run leaders at each position\"). When interleague play occurred, and an American League team was playing at a National League stadium, the pitcher would have to hit and vice versa. In 2022, the National League officially gave in and officially adopted the Designated Hitter rule. Although adding a designated hitter to the National League would eliminate moments like Bartolo Colon hitting his famous home run in 2016, it could allow the National League to bring up more power hitters to the plate and rest their pitchers. On the surface, having designated hitters instead of pitchers would create a more effective offense as they hit for power. They typically have more hits and home runs than an average pitcher, which would allow more runs to be produced per game. According to Braves pitcher Charlie Morton, \"'I don't think anyone wants to watch me strike out on three pitches and walk back to the dugout 98 times out of a hundred'\" (Kurkjian). With that being said, some pitchers were also great hitters, as Madison Bumgarner hit two grand slams in his career, which is as many as Pete Rose and Derek Jeter had in 25"

The findings provide a data-driven perspective on shot success in professional basketball.

      "text": "Lance Armstrong was once an icon. In 1993, he became the professional world champion of the Union Cycliste Internationale Road World Championship. In 1996, at the age of 25, he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer. He was free of cancer by 1997 and, in that same year, founded the nonprofit organization the Lance Armstrong Foundation (now the Livestrong Foundation) to support cancer patients and others affected by cancer. This organization went on to raise nearly $400 million through the sale of yellow Livestrong bracelets and other fundraising efforts. Between 1999 and 2005, Armstrong achieved an unprecedented seven consecutive wins of the Tour de France. But shadowing this success were allegations that he had used banned performance-enhancing drugs. After an investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in 2012, evidence of Armstrong\u2019s doping activities was verified. He was banned from Olympic sports for life and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles. In a 2013 televised interview with Oprah Winfrey, Armstrong admitted, for the first time, to using banned performance-enhancing drugs for years. Armstrong noted that he did so to remain competitive because other cyclists were also doping. \u201cThe definition of \u2018cheat\u2019 is to gain an advantage on a rival or foe that they don\u2019t have,\u201d Armstrong told Winfrey, \u201cI didn\u2019t view it that way. I viewed it as a level playing field.\u201d He was not alone. Doping had become common in many sports during the 1990s. During the seven years that Armstrong won the Tour de France, 20 out of the 21 top three finishers were also found to have doped at some point in their careers. Armstrong also encouraged his teammates on the U.S. cycling team to use performance-enhancing drugs and match his performance. The investigation into Armstrong\u2019s doping revealed how extensive his use of drugs was, how he developed a system to maintain secrecy, and how his teammates were pressured into doping, as well.

Objective To examine whether an association between a sudden change in weekly running distance and running-related injury varies according to injury type. Background: It is widely accepted that a sudden increase in running distance is strongly related to injury in runners. But the scientific knowledge supporting this assumption is limited. Methods: A volunteer sample of 874 healthy novice runners who started a self-structured running regimen were provided a global-positioning-system watch. After each running session during the study period, participants were categorized into 1 of the following exposure groups, based on the progression of their weekly running distance: less than 10% or regression, 10% to 30%, or more than 30%. The primary outcome was running-related injury. Results: A total of 202 runners sustained a running-related injury. Using Cox regression analysis, no statistically significant differences in injury rates were found across the 3 exposure groups. An increased rate of distance-related injuries (patellofemoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, medial tibial stress syndrome, gluteus medius injury, greater trochanteric bursitis, injury to the tensor fascia latae, and patellar tendinopathy) existed in those who progressed their weekly running distance by more than 30% compared with those who progressed less than 10% (hazard ratio = 1.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 2.66; P = .07).

Frequent exercise is robustly associated with a decrease in cardiovascular mortality as well as the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Physically active individuals have lower blood pressure, higher insulin sensitivity, and a more favorable plasma lipoprotein profile. Animal models of exercise show that repeated physical activity suppresses atherogenesis and increases the availability of vasodilatory mediators such as nitric oxide. Exercise has also been found to have beneficial effects on the heart. Acutely, exercise increases cardiac output and blood pressure, but individuals adapted to exercise show lower resting heart rate and cardiac hypertrophy. Both cardiac and vascular changes have been linked to a variety of changes in tissue metabolism and signaling, although our understanding of the contribution of the underlying mechanisms remains incomplete.

      "text": "Abstract The Ashanti region in Ghana, abundant in natural resources such as forests and vegetation biomes, significantly supports the livelihoods of a significant portion of the population. The sustainable management of forest resources remains a significant challenge to achieving environmental and economic growth and poverty alleviation. The study aims to identify the drivers of deforestation and assess its impact on the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable communities in the Ashanti region. The study utilized qualitative and space-based data to examine the patterns of vegetation cover and deforestation from 2000 to 2020. The results revealed moderate to sparse vegetation in Ashanti from 2002, 2005, 2011, 2015, 2017, and 2018, with no vegetation in the northcentral part, attributed to climate change, agricultural practices, government policies, and deforestation-related disasters. The study found a significant correlation (R\u00b2 = 0.8197) between years and deforestation areas, especially in 2018 at around 16,000 Sqkm, indicating an exponential increase with severe implications for sustainable livelihoods. Much of these changes were reflected in 2020 with a high peak of deforestation towards the southeastern parts of the region. Additionally, the results show that the poor groups are not passive actors but are actively involved in identifying systems and processes through which to build their adaptive capacity and resilience to environmental and climate change-induced changes. The findings provide evidence-based and all-inclusive approaches that would encourage vulnerable and marginalized groups to participate in the co-production and co-creation of policies and strategies. This outcome is geared towards transformative and sustainable communities while ensuring efficient and effective response and recovery capacities of deforested lands.

However, there is a complex system of currents flowing through every part of the ocean that plays a crucial role in shaping marine ecology. From tiny plankton to massive whales, all life in the ocean is affected by these powerful movements of water. Ocean currents are driven by various factors such as wind, temperature, and salinity. They can be classified into two types: surface currents and deep-water currents. Surface currents are driven by wind patterns and move in circular paths known as gyres. Deep-water currents, on the other hand, are caused by differences in density and temperature and flow at depths below 1,000 meters. These intricate movements of water affect everything from nutrient distribution to migration patterns for marine animals. In this article, we will explore how ocean currents impact marine ecology and why it\u2019s important to understand their effects on our plan",

    "gold_answer": "Balancing economic growth with climate action often creates conflicts between stakeholders such as businesses, governments, and environmental advocates because businesses may prioritize economic development and profit, potentially resisting regulations that could increase operational costs. Governments might face pressures to stimulate economic growth while also addressing environmental concerns, which can lead to conflicting policy priorities. Environmental advocates typically emphasize the urgency of climate action, advocating for stringent measures that may be perceived as hindering economic growth. This dynamic creates a debate over the best path forward, balancing immediate economic benefits with long-term environmental sustainability.",

While the effects of ocean warming and acidification on ecology and ecosystem functions and services are being comprehensively researched, less attention is directed toward understanding the impacts of human-driven ocean salinity changes. The global water cycle operates through water fluxes expressed as precipitation, evaporation, and freshwater runoff from land. Changes to these in turn modulate ocean salinity and shape the marine and coastal environment by affecting ocean currents, stratification, oxygen saturation, and sea level rise. Besides the direct impact on ocean physical processes, salinity changes impact ocean biological functions with the ecophysiological consequences are being poorly understood. T",

In 2018, over 39 million people worldwide were affected by changing weather patterns, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. If left unchecked, climate change will cause average global temperatures to increase beyond 3\u00b0C, and will adversely affect every ecosystem. Today we can take actions that will lead to more jobs, great prosperity, and better lives for all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building climate resilience. Infographic and Overview Why It Matters Things To Do The Five Targets Sustainable Development Goal #13 is all about looking closely at how climate change is affecting the world and taking swift action to mitigate and adapt to combat it. At the University of Minnesota, research on climate change and its impact is conducted systemwide and looks at everything from how we can adapt to mitigate the potential effects of climate change by developing more climate resilient plants and crops, to designing buildings that can better withstand extreme weather, to how we can change University policies and systems to limit our impact on the environment, to sharing with the public how climate change affects them and training future climate warriors who will advocate for needed changes and partnerships well into the future.

Given the rate at which ocean chemistry is changing, marine plants and animals may not have time to adapt or migrate as they did in the past. Because of acidification, marine life face a two-fold challenge: decreased availability and increased acidity.

The carbon dioxide data on Mauna Loa constitute the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere. They were started by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March of 1958 at a facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Keeling, 1976]. NOAA started its own CO2 measurements in May of 1974, and they have run in parallel with those made by Scripps since then [Thoning, 1989]. The last five complete years of the Mauna Loa CO2 record plus the current year are shown in the first graph. The full record of combined Scripps data and NOAA data is shown in the second graph. Every monthly mean is the average of daily means, which are in turn based on hourly averages, but only for those hours during which \u201cbackground\u201d conditions prevail (see gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html for more information). The red lines and symbols represent the monthly mean values, centered on the middle of each month. The black lines and symbols represent the same, after correction for the average seasonal cycle. The latter is determined as a moving average of SEVEN adjacent seasonal cycles centered on the month to be corrected, except for the first and last THREE and one-half years of the record, where the seasonal cycle has been averaged over the first and last SEVEN years, respectively. The vertical bars on the black lines of the first graph show the uncertainty of each monthly mean based on the observed variability of CO2 in different weather systems as they go past the top of Mauna Loa. This is manifest in the deviations of daily means from a smooth curve that follows the seasonal cycle [Thoning, 1989].

However, as economic activity rebounded after the height of the pandemic, emissions increased from 2020 to 2022 by 5.7 percent, largely driven by an increase in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion.",

Key Points - In 2022, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaled 6,343 million metric tons (14.0 trillion pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalents. This total represents a 3.0 percent decrease since 1990, down from a high of 15.2 percent above 1990 levels in 2007. The sharp decline in emissions from 2019 to 2020 was largely due to the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on travel and economic activity. Emissions increased from 2020 to 2022 by 5.7 percent, driven largely by an increase in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion due to economic activity rebounding after the height of the pandemic (Figure 1). - For the United States, during the period from 1990 to 2022 (Figure 1): - Emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities, decreased by 2 percent. - Methane emissions decreased by 19 percent, as reduced emissions from landfills, coal mines, and natural gas systems more than offset increases in emissions from activities such as livestock production.1 - Nitrous oxide emissions, predominantly from agricultural soil management practices such as the use of nitrogen as a fertilizer, decreased by 5 percent. - Emissions of fluorinated gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and nitrogen trifluoride), released as a result of commercial, industrial, and household uses, increased by 58 percent. - Among the various sectors of the U.S. economy, transportation accounts for the largest share\u201428.4 percent\u2014of 2022 emissions. Transportation has been the largest contributing sector since 2017. Electric power (power plants) accounts for the next largest share of 2022 emissions, accounting for approximately 25 percent of emissions.

      "text": "2021 Global climate summary: 6th-warmest year on record The climate scorekeepers at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information have finished their analysis of 2021 climate and issued their annual summary. Here are the opening remarks: For 2021, the average temperature across global surfaces was 1.51\u00b0F (0.84\u00b0C) above the 20th-century average. This was the sixth highest among all years in the 1880-2021 record. The year 2021 marks the 45th consecutive year (since 1977) with global temperatures, at least nominally, above the 20th-century average. The nine years spanning 2013 through 2021 rank among the 10-warmest years on record. For the 21-year span that is considered a reasonable surrogate for pre-industrial conditions (1880\u20131900), the 2021 global land and ocean temperature was 1.87\u00b0F (1.04\u00b0C) above the average. The annual global surface temperature has increased at an average rate of +0.14\u00b0F (+0.08\u00b0C) per decade since 1880; however, since 1981 the average rate of increase is more than twice that rate (+0.32\u00b0F / +0.18\u00b0C). The big temperature story of the year was the double-dip La Ni\u00f1a\u2014the cool phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The pattern was in place at the start of the year, leaving a broad swath of cooler-than-average water across the Pacific Ocean. It persisted through Northern Hemisphere winter, and weakened through spring and summer, before re-emerging in late fall. According to the NCEI summary, The 2021 Northern Hemisphere surface temperature was the sixth highest in the 142-year record at 1.96\u00b0F (1.09\u00b0C) above the 20th century average. Of note, the Northern Hemisphere land surface temperature was the third highest on record. Only the years of 2016 (second) and 2020 (warmest) were warmer. Meanwhile, the 2021 Southern Hemisphere surface temperature was the ninth highest on record. Record-high temperatures over land surfaces were measured across parts of northern Africa, southern Asia, and southern South"

Some press reports in the 1970s speculated about continued cooling; these did not accurately reflect the scientific literature of the time, which was generally more concerned with warming from an enhanced greenhouse effect.[1] In the mid 1970s, the limited temperature series available suggested that the temperature had decreased for several decades up to then. As longer time series of higher quality became available, it became clear that global temperature showed significant increases overall.[citation needed] Introduction: general awareness and concern [edit]By the 1970s, scientists were becoming increasingly aware that estimates of global temperatures showed cooling since 1945, as well as the possibility of large scale warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases.

While aerosol in the troposphere is generally washed out by the hydrological cycle within a few weeks, sufficiently large eruptions can inject material into the stratosphere. In particular, the most influential eruptions on global climate are large tropical eruptions (e.g., Robock and Mao 1995; Robock 2000). Volcanoes emit both ash and sulfuric compounds that oxidize and form sulfuric acid aerosol droplets; it is thought that the latter is most important in the stratosphere (Robock 2000). Following large tropical eruptions, like that of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation, or meridional overturning circulation of the stratosphere, lifts and meridionally spreads these droplets (Trepte et al. 1993; Hitchman et al. 1994), allowing them to persist in the middle atmosphere with an e-folding lifetime of approximately one ",

      "text": "The study examines the leading emitters of greenhouse gases as well as their supply networks The quantity of wind that blows across the world could more than meet the world\u2019s power needs. Despite this, fossil fuels still provided 63.3 percent of global power in 2019, primarily coal and gas, contributing considerably to the roughly 33 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emitted that year. Wind energy, according to a recent research, may play a bigger role in avoiding the climate catastrophe than it does today. The analysis showed that boosting the world\u2019s wind energy generating capacity may cut global warming by 0.3 to 0.8 degrees Celsius by 2100, as the world strives to meet the Paris Agreement\u2019s objective of keeping global warming far below 2 degrees Celsius. The research also looked at wind energy growth patterns in the world\u2019s four largest greenhouse gas emitters: China, the United States, the European Union, and India. Wind energy has expanded significantly in the last two decades, with the study\u2019s authors estimating that annual growth in wind energy generating capacity was about 14% from 2006 to 2020. However, achieving its climate-change mitigation potential would need a fast expansion of wind energy infrastructure, taking advantage of the resource\u2019s broad availability and low installation costs. Professors Rebecca Barthelmie and Sara Pryor of Cornell University, the study\u2019s authors, were wondering how much wind energy expansion might be expedited if governments made it a priority rather than depending only on market forces. \u201cHow big of a difference might [wind energy] make if we put some political will behind it?\u201d And I believe we\u2019ve demonstrated that \u2013 that it\u2019s substantial,\u201d Barthelmie added.

With the development of electric power, wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally generated power. Throughout the 20th century, parallel paths developed small wind plants suitable for farms or residences and larger utility-scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power.

The planet warming is linked to greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the more greenhouse gases that get added to the atmosphere, the more the global sea level will rise. How much it rises will depend on the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere moving forward. To explore the possibilities, scientists use emission scenarios. These show the possible range, from low to high, for the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere between now and 2100. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) from August 2021 used these emission scenarios to project sea level rise by 2100. They found that global sea levels could rise by anywhere between 0.9 to 3.3 feet (0.27 to 1.01 meters) by 2100, with even higher amounts possible depending on what happens with the ice sheets. The 2022 Interagency Technical Report created five sea level scenarios to show different levels that sea level rise could reach in the United States. These include different levels of greenhouse gas emissions, global warming, and water added to the ocean from land ice melting. All of the scenarios had sea levels rising around 12 inches (0.3 meters) by 2050. Then, the most likely scenarios had sea levels rising from 2.3 to 4 feet (0.7 to 1.2 meters) by 2100 in the U.S. depending on greenhouse gas emissions today and in the future. Although, higher levels are possible in some locations, such as the Gulf Coast. Other factors, such as changes in land height and ocean currents, play a large role in local sea level change and will continue to do so in the future. Scientists are continuously improving their understanding of how ice sheets and glaciers are melting. Thus, each time these values are calculated, they provide improved estimates of what could happen. If scientists find that the glaciers are melting fast"

Ocean currents move both horizontally, on scales that can span entire oceans, as well as vertically, with vertical currents (upwelling and downwelling) playing an important role in the movement of nutrients and gases, such as carbon dioxide, between the surface and the deep ocean. Ocean currents flow for great distances and together they create the global conveyor belt, which plays a dominant role in determining the climate of many of Earth's regions. More specifically, ocean currents influence the temperature of the regions through which they travel. ",

We know what we\u2019re looking at when brown haze settles over a city, exhaust billows across a busy highway, or a plume rises from a smokestack. Some air pollution is not seen, but its pungent smell alerts you. It is a major threat to global health and prosperity. Air pollution, in all forms, is responsible for more than 6.5 million deaths each year globally, a number that has increased over the past two decades. What Is Air Pollution? Air pollution is a mix of hazardous substances from both human-made and natural sources. Vehicle emissions, fuel oils and natural gas to heat homes, by-products of manufacturing and power generation, particularly coal-fueled power plants, and fumes from chemical production are the primary sources of human-made air pollution. Nature releases hazardous substances into the air, such as smoke from wildfires, which are often caused by people; ash and gases from volcanic eruptions; and gases, like methane, which are emitted from decomposing organic matter in soils. Traffic-Related Air Pollution (TRAP), a mixture of gasses and particles, has most of the elements of human-made air pollution: ground-level ozone, various forms of carbon, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and fine particulate matter. Ozone, an atmospheric gas, is often called smog when at ground level. It is created when pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, industrial boilers, refineries, and other sources chemically react in the presence of sunlight. Noxious gases, which include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur oxides (SOx), are components of motor vehicle emissions and byproducts of industrial processes. Particulate matter (PM) is composed of chemicals such as sulfates, nitrates, carbon, or mineral dusts.

Admittedly, our national labs haven\u2019t quite figured out time travel just yet, but they do analyze power.

To help put this number in perspective, it\u2019s important to know just how big 1 GW is. A watt is a measure of power and there are 1 billion watts in 1 GW.

Liberal Protestantism\u2019s long decline started in the 1950s, when congregants began to wonder if their ministers still believed the old creeds (they didn\u2019t). Communism dies wherever it\u2019s tried because sooner or later the proletariat realize their self-appointed champions aren\u2019t particularly interested in equality. Many sects and cults dwindle the moment their supposedly ascetic leaders are revealed to be libertines.\n\nSomething similar is happening to climate ideology.\n\nFor three decades you were labeled a crank, a \u201cclimate denier,\u201d someone who pigheadedly rejects \u201csettled science,\u201d if you didn\u2019t embrace the belief that life on earth faces imminent extinction from \u201cglobal warming\u201d and, later, \u201cclimate change.\u201d The poss",

By shackling investment to poor countries, tied only to 'green' investment, poor countries are left without investment in education, technology, clean water, food, healthcare, woman rights, et.al.\n\n>Trump\u2019s forthcoming rejection will undermine the credibility of international efforts to address climate change and simultaneously provide a convenient scapegoat for the multi-decade failure of the United Nations\u2019 climate-policy process to do very much about it. But the impending U.S. pullout will also give the 77 low-income and lower-middle-income nations\u2014which account for almost half the global population\u2014the opportunity to abandon a process that has clearly not served them and, indeed, has often justified their continuing impoverishment.\n\n>But not only have rich countries failed to deliver, they also now routinely use the specter of catastrophic climate change to deny poor countries",

          "text": "Introduction Understanding ocean salinity is critical for grasping the intricate relationships within marine ecosystems. The concentration of salt in seawater plays an essential role in shaping the environment where diverse aquatic species thrive. Variations in salt levels influence not just the types of organisms present but also their behaviors and interactions within delicate habitats. Saltwater fish exhibit adaptations that allow them to survive in high salinity, managing their internal salt concentration through processes like osmoregulation. In contrast, some species inhabit brackish waters, where freshwater mixes with seawater, creating unique challenges and opportunities. These areas often host different communities, demonstrating how biodiversity flourishes in response to environmental changes. Moreover, the health of ocean chemistry depends heavily on salinity. Changes in salt levels can alter nutrient availability, impacting food webs and ultimately, the survival of various ",
