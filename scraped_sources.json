The goal is to determine whether something is both safe and effective.\nA variety of things are evaluated through clinical trials, including:\n- medications\n- medication combinations\n- new uses for existing medications\n- medical devices\nBefore doing a clinical trial, investigators conduct preclinical research using human cell cultures or animal models. For example, they might test whether a new medication is toxic to a small sample of human cells in a laboratory.\nIf the preclinical research is promising, they move forward with a clinical trial to see how well it works in humans.

Spent 3 days, skipped a workout, and drank too much coffee but came out of it questioning every \u2018fortified\u2019 label I\u2019ve ever read. If you lift, supplement, or just like nerding out on micronutrients this one\u2019s for you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t fearmongering. It\u2019s nuance. Because not all B9 is equal, and how you absorb, use, and respond to it depends on what you eat, your genetics, and how many \"one a day\" pills you stack each morning without blinking.\n\nLet\u2019s talk mechanisms, dosing risks, MTHFR variants, and the quiet cancer signal buried in meta-analyses most people never read past the abstract.\n\n# 1.

I\u2019ve spent the vast majority of it trying remedies and plant-based solutions. Everything from hearsay to ancient wisdom. Over time, at least from my own personal experience, I have isolated what truly works and what doesn\u2019t.

Simple Rosemary oil (4/10)**\n\nHow long did I use it, and method:\n\nI used rosemary oil consistently for about 6 months. I diluted 5-7 drops of rosemary essential oil into a tablespoon of almond oil and massaged it into my scalp twice a week. I left it on for 1-2 hours before washing my hair with a mild shampoo. \n\nOther variables:\n\nMoved to a new country. Might have led to changes in water quality (only for the better!). Where I was",

And forget about the fact that finasteride is not FDA-approved for women and still gets prescribed or recommended commonly (with serious side effects to child birth and mental health)\n\nI reposted [this particular post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/1iuvyqa/update_ive_spent_3_years_testing_different_herbs/)from our subreddit to a hair loss group and got so heavily derided that I eventually deleted and decided to quit that group!
