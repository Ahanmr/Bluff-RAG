    "text": "Sodium in Your Diet\nUse the Nutrition Facts Label and Reduce Your Intake\nYou\u2019ve probably heard that most Americans eat too much sodium. Your body needs a small amount of sodium to work properly, but too much sodium can be bad for your health. Diets higher in sodium are associated with an increased risk of developing high blood pressure, which is a major cause of stroke and heart disease.\nDespite what many people think, most dietary sodium (over 70%) comes from eating packaged and prepared foods\u2014not from table salt added to food when cooking or eating. The food supply contains too much sodium and Americans who want to consume less sodium can have a difficult time doing so. That is why the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is working with the food industry to make reasonable reductions in sodium across a wide variety of foods. Even though sodium may already be in many packaged foods when you purchase them, you can lower your daily sodium intake by using the Nutrition Facts label.\nLook at the Label!\nUse the Nutrition Facts label as your tool to make informed decisions!\n- Know the Daily Value. The Daily Values are reference amounts of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day. The Daily Value for sodium is less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) per day.\nUse % Daily Value (%DV) as a tool. The %DV is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of the food and shows how much of a nutrient contributes to a total daily diet.\nUse %DV to determine if a serving of the food is high or low in sodium and to compare and choose foods to get less than 100% DV of sodium each day.\nAs a general guide: 5% DV or less of sodium per serving is considered low, and 20% DV or more of sodium per serving is considered high.\n- Pay attention to servings. The nutrition information listed on the Nutrition Facts label is usually based on one serving of the food. Check the serving size and the number of servings you eat or drink to determine how much sodium you are consuming.\nFood Choices Matter!\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 40% of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from the following foods:\n- Deli meat sandwiches\n- Pizza\n- Burritos and tacos\n- Soups\n- Savory Snacks (e.g. chips, crackers, popcorn)\n- Poultry\n- Pasta mixed dishes\n- Burgers\n- Egg dishes and omelets\nBut remember, the sodium content can vary significantly between similar types of foods. So, use the Nutrition Facts label to compare products, and don\u2019t forget to check the serving size in order to make an accurate comparison.\nTable Salt and Sodium: Defined\nThe words \u201ctable salt\u201d and \u201csodium\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they do not mean the same thing. Table salt (also known by its chemical name, sodium chloride) is a crystal-like compound that is abundant in nature. Sodium is a mineral, and one of the chemical elements found in salt.\nSodium as a Food Ingredient\nAs a food ingredient, sodium has multiple uses, such as for curing meat, baking, thickening, retaining moisture, enhancing flavor (including the flavor of other ingredients), and as a preservative. Some common food additives\u2014like monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), sodium nitrite, and sodium benzoate\u2014also contain sodium and contribute (in lesser amounts) to the total amount of \u201csodium\u201d listed on the Nutrition Facts label.\nSurprisingly, some foods that don\u2019t taste salty can still be high in sodium, which is why using taste alone is not an accurate way to judge a food\u2019s sodium content. For example, while some foods that are high in sodium (like pickles and soy sauce) taste salty, there are also many foods (like cereals and pastries) that contain sodium but don\u2019t taste salty. Also, some foods that you may eat several times a day (such as breads) can add up to a lot of sodium over the course of a day, even though an individual serving may not be high in sodium.\nCheck the Package for Nutrient Claims\nYou can also check for nutrient claims on food and beverage packages to quickly identify those that may contain less sodium. Here\u2019s a guide to common claims and what they mean:\nWhat It Says | What It Means |\n| Salt/Sodium-Free | Less than 5 mg of sodium per serving |\n| Very Low Sodium | 35 mg of sodium or less per serving |\n| Low Sodium | 140 mg of sodium or less per serving |\n| Reduced Sodium | At least 25% less sodium than the regular product |\n| Light in Sodium or Lightly Salted | At least 50% less sodium than the regular product |\n| No-Salt-Added or Unsalted | No salt is added during processing \u2013 but these products may not be salt/sodium-free unless stated |\nSodium and Blood Pressure\nSodium attracts water, and a high-sodium diet draws water into the bloodstream, which can increase the volume of blood and subsequently your blood pressure. High blood pressure (also known as hypertension) is a condition in which blood pressure remains elevated over time. Hypertension makes the heart work too hard, and the high force of the blood flow ca"

If so, it could lead to serious health problems.\nSodium is a mineral. You can find it naturally in food, such as celery or milk. Manufacturers may also add sodium to processed food, such as bread. Sodium also is used to flavor food in condiments, such as soy sauce. When sodium is combined with another mineral called chloride, the two make table salt.\nThe daily limit set by nutrition experts in the U.S. is 2,300 milligrams (mg) a day for people ages 14 and older. The World Health Organization suggests a limit of 2,000 mg of sodium a day. Most of the sodium you eat is hidden in prepared foods. And for that reason, many people worldwide take in more sodium than their bodies need. This can put them at higher risk of a long-term illness such as high blood pressure, also called hype",

        "text": "Abstract\nDietary salt reduction of Americans has been a focus of public health initiatives for more than 40 years primarily due to the association between high salt intake and development of hypertension. Despite past efforts, salt intake of Americans has remained at levels well above dietary recommendations, likely due in part to the hedonic appeal of salty taste. As such, in 2010 the Institute of Medicine suggested a strategy of gradual salt reduction of processed foods, the primary source of Americans\u2019 dietary salt intake, via an approach intended to minimize impact on consumer acceptability of lower-sodium foods. This brief review discusses the ontogeny and development of human salt taste preference, the role of experience in shifting salt preference, and sources of dietary salt. Our current understanding of shifting human salt taste preference is discussed within the context of potential opportunities for success in reducing dietary salt, and gaps in the research that both limit o",
