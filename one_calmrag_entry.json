  "question": "Why is Phase 3 of clinical trials crucial for identifying rare side effects of a drug, and how does it build upon previous phases?",
  "gold_answer": "Phase 3 is crucial for identifying rare side effects because it involves a larger and more diverse group of participants over an extended period, increasing the chances of detecting less common side effects that might not appear in smaller, shorter studies. It builds upon previous phases by using the safety and efficacy data gathered from Phases 1 and 2 to design a robust trial that confirms the drug's treatment benefits and ensures comprehensive safety profiling.",

    "text": "Step 3: Clinical Research\nWhile preclinical research answers basic questions about a drug\u2019s safety, it is not a substitute for studies of ways the drug will interact with the human body. \u201cClinical research\u201d refers to studies, or trials, that are done in people. As the developers design the clinical study, they will consider what they want to accomplish for each of the different Clinical Research Phases and begin the Investigational New Drug Process (IND), a process they must go through before clinical research begins.\nOn this page you will find information on:\n-\nDesigning Clinical Trials\nDesigning Clinical Trials\nResearchers design clinical trials to answer specific research questions related to a medical product. These trials follow a specific study plan, called a protocol, that is developed by the researcher or manufacturer. Before a clinical trial begins, researchers review prior information about the drug to develop research questions and objectives. Then, they decide:\n-\nWho qualifies to participate (selection criteria)\n-\nHow many people will be part of the study\n-\nHow long the study will last\n-\nWhether there will be a control group and other ways to limit research bias\n-\nHow the drug will be given to patients and at what dosage\n-\nWhat assessments will be conducted, when, and what data will be collected\n-\nHow the data will be reviewed and analyzed\nClinical trials follow a typical series from early, small-scale, Phase 1 studies to late-stage, large scale, Phase 3 studies.\nWhat are the Clinical Trial Phases?\nWatch this video to learn about the three phases of clinical trials.\nClinical Research Phase Studies\nPhase 1\nStudy Participants: 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or people with the disease/condition.\nLength of Study: Several months\nDuring Phase 1 studies, researchers test a new drug in normal volunteers (healthy people). In most cases, 20 to 80 healthy volunteers or people with the disease/condition participate in Phase 1. However, if a new drug is intended for use in cancer patients, researchers conduct Phase 1 studies in patients with that type of cancer.\nPhase 1 studies are closely monitored and gather information about how a drug interacts with the human body. Researchers adjust dosing schemes based on animal data to find out how much of a drug the body can tolerate and what its acute side effects are.\nAs a Phase 1 trial continues, researchers answer research questions related to how it works in the body, the side effects associated with increased dosage, and early information about how effective it is to determine how best to administer the drug to limit risks and maximize possible benefits. This is important to the design of Phase 2 studies.\nApproximately 70% of drugs move to the next phase\nPhase 2\nStudy Participants: Up to several hundred people with the disease/condition.\nLength of Study: Several months to 2 years\nPurpose: Efficacy and side effects\nIn Phase 2 studies, researchers administer the drug to a group of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug is being developed. Typically involving a few hundred patients, these studies aren't large enough to show whether the drug will be beneficial.\nInstead, Phase 2 studies provide researchers with additional safety data. Researchers use these data to refine research questions, develop research methods, and design new Phase 3 research protocols.\nApproximately 33% of drugs move to the next phase\nPhase 3\nStudy Participants: 300 to 3,000 volunteers who have the disease or condition\nLength of Study: 1 to 4 years\nResearchers design Phase 3 studies to demonstrate whether or not a product offers a treatment benefit to a specific population. Sometimes known as pivotal studies, these studies involve 300 to 3,000 participants.\nPhase 3 studies provide most of the safety data. In previous studies, it is possible that less common side effects might have gone undetected. Because these studies are larger and longer in duration, the results are more likely to show long-term or rare side effects\nApproximately 25-30% of drugs move to the next phase\nPhase 4\nStudy Participants: Several thousand volunteers who have the disease/condition\nPhase 4 trials are carried out once the drug or device has been approved by FDA during the Post-Market Safety Monitoring\nLearn more about Clinical Trials.\nThe Investigational New Drug Process\nDrug developers, or sponsors, must submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to FDA before beginning clinical research.\nIn the IND application, developers must include:\n-\nAnimal study data and toxicity (side effects that cause great harm) data\n-\nManufacturing information\n-\nClinical protocols (study plans) for studies to be conducted\n-\nData from any prior human research\nAsking for FDA Assistance\nDrug developers are free to ask for help from FDA at any point in the drug development process, including:\n-\nPre-IND application, to review FDA guidance documents and get answers to questions that may help enhance their research\n-\nAfte"

Despite the reforms of 20 years ago and the general inclusion of women in drug clinical trials, we have yet to see data routinely analyzed and reported by sex. Major journals are not requiring it, and large, publicly available datasets, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, are not systematically collecting and pointing to it.

This is determined through frequent blood draws (usually in an inpatient environment) to check for the level of drug in the blood plasma.\nPharmacokinetic trials are usually considered Phase I trials regardless of when they are conducted during a drug's development. Dosage range of a new drug is determined by administering increasingly larger doses to one or more groups of subjects, who are closely monitored for harmful side effects.
