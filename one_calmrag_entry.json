There are precautions you can take to prevent spreading it to others: isolation, masking, and avoiding contact with people who are at high risk of getting very sick. Isolation is used to separate people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 from those without COVID-19.\nThese recommendations do not change based on COVID-19 hospital admission levels. If you have COVID-19, also see additional information on treatments that may be available to you.\nThis information is intended for a general audience. Healthcare professionals should see Ending Isolation and Precautions for People with COVID-19. This CDC guidance is meant to supplement\u2014not replace\u2014any federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations.\nFor Healthcare Professionals: Ending Isolation and Precautions for People with COVID-19\nRegardless of vaccination status, you should isolate from others when you have COVID-19.\nYou should also isolate if you are sick and suspect that you have COVID-19 but do not yet have test results. If your results are positive, follow the full isolation recommendations below. If your results are negative, you can end your isolation.\nYou can end your isolation\nFollow the full isolation recommendations below\nWhen you have COVID-19, isolation is counted in days, as follows:\nIf you had no symptoms\n- Day 0 is the day you were tested (not the day you received your positive test result)\n- Day 1 is the first full day following the day you were tested\n- If you develop symptoms within 10 days of when you were tested, the clock restarts at day 0 on the day of symptom onset\nIf you had symptoms\n- Day 0 of isolation is the day of symptom onset, regardless of when you tested positive\n- Day 1 is the first full day after the day your symptoms started\nIf you test positive for COVID-19, stay home for at least 5 days and isolate from others in your home.\nYou are likely most infectious during these first 5 days.\n- Wear a high-quality mask if you must be around others at home and in public.\n- Do not go places where you are unable to wear a mask. For travel guidance, see CDC\u2019s Travel webpage.\n- Do not travel.\n- Stay home and separate from others as much as possible.\n- Use a separate bathroom, if possible.\n- Take steps to improve ventilation at home, if possible.\n- Don\u2019t share personal household items, like cups, towels, and utensils.\n- Monitor your symptoms. If you have an emergency warning sign (like trouble breathing), seek emergency medical care immediately.\n- Learn more about what to do if you have COVID-19.\nEnd isolation based on how serious your COVID-19 symptoms were. Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation.\nIf you had no symptoms\nYou may end isolation after day 5.\nIf you had symptoms and:\nYour symptoms are improving\nYou may end isolation after day 5 if:\n- You are fever-free for 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medication).\nYour symptoms are not improving\nContinue to isolate until:\n- You are fever-free for 24 hours (without the use of fever-reducing medication).\n- Your symptoms are improving. 1\nIf you had symptoms and had:\nModerate illness (you experienced shortness of breath or had difficulty breathing)\nYou need to isolate through day 10.\nSevere illness (you were hospitalized) or have a weakened immune system\n- You need to isolate through day 10.\n- Consult your doctor before ending isolation.\n- Ending isolation without a viral test may not be an option for you.\nIf you are unsure if your symptoms are moderate or severe or if you have a weakened immune system, talk to a healthcare provider for further guidance.\nRegardless of when you end isolation\nUntil at least day 11:\n- Avoid being around people who are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19.\n- Remember to wear a high-quality mask when indoors around others at home and in public.\n- Do not go places where you are unable to wear a mask until you are able to discontinue masking (see below).\n- For travel guidance, see CDC\u2019s Travel webpage.\nAfter you have ended isolation, when you are feeling better (no fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and symptoms improving),\n- Wear your mask through day 10.\nOR\n- If you have access to antigen tests, you should consider using them. With two sequential negative tests 48 hours apart, you may remove your mask sooner than day 10.\nNote: If your antigen test results1 are positive, you may still be infectious. You should continue wearing a mask and wait at least 48 hours before taking another test. Continue taking antigen tests at least 48 hours apart until you have two sequential negative results.

By Carla Delgado Updated on November 12, 2024 Fact checked by Jillian Dara Verywell Health / Design by Michela Buttignol / Getty Images Key Takeaways According to the CDC, mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptom onset.If you test negative on a rapid antigen test, make sure to get tested again a few days later to ensure you don\u2019t get a false negative. If you have a COVID-19 infection, it\u2019s important to take the appropriate precautions to avoid spreading the virus. According to Joseph Bailey, MD, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Medicine, the infectious period for COVID-19 begins one to two days before symptom onset, and viral loads should peak around two to three days after. \u201cHowever, the exact period of time someone is contagious varies based on the severity of the COVID infection, vaccination status, and the person\u2019s immune system,\u201d Bailey told Verywell. \u201cPeople w",
